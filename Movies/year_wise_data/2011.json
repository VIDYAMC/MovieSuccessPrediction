They are named Basu, PK Lele, Kuch Bhi Singh Gaurav. The last one is Aakash who is comparatively restricted, and is also the central character of the film, which by all measure didn't have a written script. The other four are mostly jobless and shameless. All of them, (or so I assume), are aware of their sheer incapability to get any women to be attracted towards them. \r\n\r\nSo the bustling temptation erupts by these substandard men employing tawdry tricks like deliberately dropping a coin and asking a woman who's just left the shop to get it as if it has slipped from her purse, for one. The unsuspecting female bends to collect it ? and lines as \"aaha kya nazaaraa, kya garam tawa hai ye\" follow, their eyes popping out devouring the cleavage. That is the level of horror. \r\n\r\nComing to the film's title, this vulgarly lusty Sheetal Bhabhi is the second wife of Aakash, who's always busy with 'office ka kaam' and when she demands sex, he wants to read some shoddy novel. The other friends almost kill themselves with envy as their friend has managed a sultry siren who they visit on some or the other fabricated pretext. \r\n\r\nOnce she confides in themsaying that Aakash is boring, and she is not having \"fun\". This said, all men jump into action, not knowing about each other, to arrange a sum of Rs 7 lakh for Sheetal, as she tells them she'll get a private apartment and sleep with them. They, in turn, mortgage their property overnight and loan money from people like \"Lafda Bhai\". On the supposedly exciting night, they get the declared money in gunny bags, and wrapped around their waists they dance to Sheetal bhabhis tunes. \r\n\r\nAs these nasty turn of events spin your head off, you sink further down in your seat, wishing you disappear magically in an imaginary world of your own, but? but one wannabe exotic number shot outlandishly abroad with three ugly-looking goris abruptly plays in such loud, ghastly fashion, you jolt back to scandalous realism. \r\n\r\nJust when the movie reaches a preposterously penned climax and you've given up and voluntarily surrendered to the unfolding baloney skimpily covered women parade, with the background tune going \"Yeah...ahay...yeaa...aaahey...oho\". \r\n\r\nSome more potentially disturbing and language-damaging scenes follow. Turns out Sheetal bhabhi was really a prostitute, and a tool employed by Aakash to test \"true friendship\". True friends don't sleep, or attempt to sleep with your wife, mate. Real wives turn up, and thrash the four with broomsticks. Haha, they mask their faces with the palm of their hand.","TrailerLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1eNeVNeL4k","TrailerEmbedCode":"<iframe width=\"850\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-1eNeVNeL4k\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Comedy","RatingCount":9,"Rating":2.25,"CensorRating":"U/A","ReleaseDate":"5/27/2011","Runtime":115,"Budget":0,"Revenue":0,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/DA4D58D6BEE4381B66BAE67711D20EB6.jpg"},{"Id":"bde1861c","ImdbId":"tt1877691","OriginalTitle":"Love Breakups Zindagi","Title":"Love Breakups Zindagi","Description":"Love Breakups Zindagi is a movie which does not try to answer the question related to love, breakups and life.\r\n\r\nJai (Sam) (Zayed Khan) and Naina (Dia Mirza) are almost \"settled\" in their life but missing something or someone who will complete them.

Madhavan) is an NRI doctor living in London. He comes to India to find an Indian bride and get married. His parents have already short-listed some girls for him to meet, and they take him to Kanpur to meet Tanuja \"Tanu\" Trivedi (Kangana Ranaut). After they land in Kanpur, a bunch of goons on the street pick a quarrel with Manu for no reason at all, and give him a few slaps, due to which he reaches the Trivedi residence in an untidy condition. At Tanu's house, the two sets of parents find that they get on extremely well with each other, and decide that if Manu likes Tanu, they can finalize the matter immediately. There is one minor hitch: Tanu's mother tells her guests that Tanu has been ill since yesterday and is unable to rise from bed. She asks Manu to go up to Tanu's bedroom and meet her there. She shows Manu to Tanu's room and goes away to the kitchen. Tanu is very unresponsive, and Manu initially thinks that she is shy and bashful. He soon realizes that Tanu is in fact fast asleep. He gazes upon her beautiful sleeping figure, and likes what he sees. He comes downstairs and tells both the families that he is willing to marry her.\r\n\r\nBefore making the engagement public, the families decide to go on a pilgrimage and seek the blessings of God. During the train journey, Tanu finds an opportunity to speak privately with Manu, and tells him that she had intentionally taken sleeping pills to fall asleep, to avoid meeting him. She tells him rudely that she loves someone else, and that she has her lover's name tattooed on her chest; she also tells him that the thugs who had roughed him up when he initially landed in Kanpur had been sent by her boyfriend. She demands that Manu should now reject her. Manu is extremely disappointed because he likes her immensely, and so do his parents, but he dutifully does the decent thing. Taking the blame upon himself, and not revealing to anyone the fact that the girl is having a love affair with another man, he tells his father to convey to Tanu's parents that after getting to know their daughter better, he has decided not to marry her. Tanu's parents are more than a little miffed at this turn of events, but since the forthcoming engagement was known only to them, there is no public loss of face.\r\n\r\nWeeks pass, and Manu's parents bring out other proposals from their shortlist for him to meet. He meets several prospective girls from suitable families, but cannot forget Tanu. One of the girls he meets is Ayushi (Neha Kaul), who had lost both her parents while still a child, and whose brother Raja (Jimmy Shergill) is her guardian. Raja, himself only a teenager when their parents died, had taken care of Ayushi, never letting her suffer in any way. What exactly Raja does in order to support himself and his sister is a mystery. Unknown to anyone, he is a card-sharp and part of a group of small-time gangsters who accept \"contracts\" to perform various relatively minor crimes. He is also good-hearted, compassionate to the poor, loves his sister sincerely, and wants her to be married to a decent man and to settle down as wife and mother. After meeting Ayushi, Manu tells Raja that she is a very nice girl, but that he cannot in good conscience marry her, because he harbours one-sided love for some other girl. Raja commends him for his honesty and treats him with immense respect.\r\n\r\nManu and his friend Pappi (Deepak Dobriyal) travel to Punjab to attend the wedding of another school friend Jassi (Eijaz Khan). Upon arriving, Manu finds out that Tanu is present there, and that she is a friend of Payal (Swara Bhaskar), Jassi's bride-to-be. Over the next few days, Manu and Tanu strike up a friendship. Tanu tells Manu that she is on the verge of eloping, that she and her lover are going to get secretly married in a registry office, and then present her parents with a fait accompli. She asks him to be a witness to their wedding in the registry office. As they leave on a train back to Chandigarh, they meet Raja again, and after explaining to Raja how Manu is in love with someone, Raja states they will all go back to Kanpur and promises Manu he will marry him to any girl he falls in love with. As Manu and Pappi reach Jassi's \"baraat\", Manu receives a call from Raja, revealing that Raja is Tanu's boyfriend. Manu goes to the registrar's office, where Raja and Tanu are planning to elope, but they are not able to find a pen to sign the papers! Manu has a pen in his jacket, but lies and pretends that he does not have a pen, and the marriage is postponed for lack of a pen. Manu expresses shock that Raja, whom he had regarded as a decent man and dutiful brother, should be eloping in this way. Raja tells Manu that he does not want to be married in this stealthy way, but Tanu's family would never accept him, which is why they are eloping. He requests Manu to intercede with Tanu's family and persuade them to agree to her marrying Raja. Again, Manu does the decent thing. He talks to Tanu's father, and convinces him to accept Raja. Seeing that their daughter is adamant, and relieved that an elopement has been averted, Tanu's parents accepts the situation, albeit unwillingly.\r\n\r\nPreparations for Tanu's wedding with Raja begin. Tanu accidentally sees the wedding gift that Manu is preparing for her. It is a large poster, a collage of numerous photographs of Tanu in her various moods and poses, which Manu had snapped on various occasions. He is investing the time and effort needed to painstakingly create this collage as a special wedding gift for her. Tanu is touched. Meanwhile, Raja does not have the time to buy Tanu a wedding sari, so he asks Manu to help him out. Manu hunts out a beautiful sari in the markets of the city and delivers it to Tanu. At this time, he tells Tanu how glad he is that she is getting married in a respectable manner, with the consent of parents, in the sight of God, dressed beautifully as a bride in that lovely sari. He confesses to Tanu that at the registry office, he did have a pen in his jacket, but did not want her to be married that way, and therefore he lied. At that precise moment, Raja appears, and takes Tanu away with him to meet some friends. As she walks away with Raja, Tanu has mixed feelings. She is also very conscious of how nervous and reluctant her parents are about her marrying Raja, how they have no connect with him at all, compared to how quickly they hit it off with Manu's parents and with Manu himself. That evening, after reaching home, she contacts Manu and asks him if he is in love with her. Manu gives her a truthful answer. After giving the matter some thought, Tanu decides to marry Manu, not Raja.\r\n\r\nTanu's parents are rejoiced and delighted with this turn of events. Her father makes all haste to approach Manu's parents and seek the alliance from them in the traditional manner. Manu's parents, who know nothing of recent events, are surprised to see Tanu's father at their door; after all, they had already refused him once, at the end of the disastrous pilgrimage. However, they had always liked Tanu and her family, and it was Manu who had refused to marry her. After a quick consultation with Manu, who indicates his acceptance, they duly consent to the alliance. By this time, Raja has been informed that Tanu does not wish to marry him. Furious, he storms into her house and threatens her father with dire consequences if Tanu is married to anyone other than him. Meanwhile, preparations for Tanu's wedding are continuing as usual. Tanu's father bribes an Inspector of Police as per the instruction of Pappi and Jassi, and gets Raja arrested on false charges. The plan is that Raja will remain in jail for a few days, during which time Tanu will be married and safely sent away. However, everyone is shocked to see that Raja is arriving in a wedding processional as promised, and arrives at the wedding venue at the same time as Manu, the bridegroom. Raja brandishes a gun and creates a scene. Manu however refuses to be scared and begins reasoning with Raja. Meanwhile, Tanu appears at the door, dressed as a bride, and tells she is not scared as well seeing Manu's courage and begins to walk slowly towards the altar. Raja aims the gun and almost pulls the trigger, but is not able to do it. He then reminds Manu of the promise he had made to him, and he decides to honour his promise, and tells Tanu he might be many things, but he is not a betrayer. And after seeing Tanu's love, Manu's courageousness and niceness, Raja realises that Manu is the right match for Tanu.

However, his family died in a car accident. Several years later, he is offered a job by the Chief Minister of Goa: to flush out all the drug gangsters in Goa, which he accepts. His success leads to a panic among the drug suppliers. The drug dealers gather for a meeting led by Zoey (Bipasha Basu). Zoey guarantees them that their drugs will be in safe hands if they are given to a mysterious person named Michael Barbosa. Kamath decides to chase Michael Barbosa and finds out about Ricky.\r\n\r\nWhen Kamath reaches Ricky, he is already dead. Kamath finds out about his cocaine-smuggling and his girlfriend, Rozanna (Mariah Pucu Gantois Gomes). They reach the airport on the same day Lorry is about to leave. Kamath encounters Rozanna and finds a photo of Lorry in her phone. She is allowed to go due to lack of evidence. Kamath then identifies Lorry as the person he had seen in Rozanna's phone. They detain him and find cocaine stuffed in his bag. Lorry is sent to juvenile jail, where his friend, DJ Joki Fernandes (Rana Daggubati), tries to get him out. It is then revealed that Zoey and Joki used to date. Zoey wanted to be an air hostess, but failed. Joki introduced her to his boss, Lorsa Biscuita a.k.a. the Biscuit (Aditya Pancholi), who had worldwide contacts. With the help of his contacts, Biscuit got her a job in airlines, though she had to smuggle cocaine to international regions to repay him. She ended up getting caught and was sentenced to 14 years in jail. Biscuit's contact got her free in 14 days, but to repay him, she had to sleep with Biscuit. She broke up with Joki and made her life drug-dealing with Biscuit.\r\n\r\nJoki meets Zoey and the two end up sleeping together. Zoey gives him a video of Biscuit announcing that he is going to have a rave in neighboring Karnataka, out of Kamath's jurisdiction and that Michael Barbosa will be bringing and exchanging drugs. Joki gives this tape to Kamath. When Biscuit comes to know about Zoey and Joki, he kills Zoey. After recruiting Lorry for help, Kamath attacks Biscuit's party and arrests the drug dealers. When Kamath's colleague Rane asks him about Barbosa, Kamath says that he knows the secret of Barbosa and Rane kills Kamath. It is revealed that Rane was always involved with Biscuit. Joki later finds out about Kamath's death and arrives at the crime scene, fitting together the pieces as Kamath has. Michael Barbosa is not a man but a gravesite Biscuit uses for storing drugs. We see Joki carefully storing the bags of cocaine somewhere, then calling Rane to arrange a meeting. Lorry is now free of the charge and he comes out of jail. When Joki and Rane are going to meet Biscuit, Joki kills Rane saying that he knows Rane is the person who killed Kamath. Kamath's body is being cremated in an electric furnace owned by Biscuit. We see that this is where Joki has put the drugs, and Biscuit arrives only too late. Having been brought down by the destruction of his stockpile, Biscuit is killed by a woman who may be Rozanna. Lorry comes to a beach party where Joki is singing, and Tani joins him in a joyful reunion. The film ends with Joki riding on his bike envisioning Kamath and Zoey.","TrailerLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIzjmjMMD6c","TrailerEmbedCode":"<iframe width=\"850\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QIzjmjMMD6c\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Drama","RatingCount":13,"Rating":3.1,"CensorRating":"U/A","ReleaseDate":"11/6/2011","Runtime":130,"Budget":350000000,"Revenue":540000000,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/D790938E67CE103AECAB87D3DFCA327A.jpg"},{"Id":"2466f50c","ImdbId":"tt1772872","OriginalTitle":"Game","Title":"Game","Description":"","TrailerLink":"","TrailerEmbedCode":"","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"","RatingCount":1,"Rating":2.0,"CensorRating":"","ReleaseDate":"4/1/2011","Runtime":135,"Budget":0,"Revenue":0,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/FACB7C0E65C02B51D56A12FD776FA4B7.jpg"},{"Id":"b6bd8e12","ImdbId":"tt1809399","OriginalTitle":"Utt Pataang","Title":"Utt Pataang","Description":"","TrailerLink":"","TrailerEmbedCode":"","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"","RatingCount":1,"Rating":2.0,"CensorRating":"","ReleaseDate":"2/4/2011","Runtime":135,"Budget":0,"Revenue":0,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/4D225C61190C135925DA3E61EEE0AED1.jpg"},{"Id":"fa5d11e5","ImdbId":"tt1979209","OriginalTitle":"Chala Mussaddi - Office Office","Title":"Chala Mussaddi - Office Office","Description":"","TrailerLink":"","TrailerEmbedCode":"","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"","RatingCount":1,"Rating":2.0,"CensorRating":"","ReleaseDate":"8/5/2011","Runtime":0,"Budget":0,"Revenue":0,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/B77608E24B15499880CD3CBEC199CBAB.jpg"},{"Id":"b97ddc4b","ImdbId":"tt1363363","OriginalTitle":"Chatur Singh Two Star","Title":"Chatur Singh Two Star","Description":"","TrailerLink":"","TrailerEmbedCode":"","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"","RatingCount":1,"Rating":2.0,"CensorRating":"","ReleaseDate":"8/8/2011","Runtime":150,"Budget":0,"Revenue":0,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/5305E05A17C5AE763771C68D8659A194.jpg"},{"Id":"8c89feec","ImdbId":"tt1728239","OriginalTitle":"Double Dhamaal","Title":"Double Dhamaal","Description":"","TrailerLink":"","TrailerEmbedCode":"","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"","RatingCount":1,"Rating":2.0,"CensorRating":"","ReleaseDate":"6/24/2011","Runtime":138,"Budget":0,"Revenue":0,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/81D94B4A71EA8F9A2901F5862BA11E10.jpg"},{"Id":"973d0da9","ImdbId":"tt1830786","OriginalTitle":"Rascals","Title":"Rascals","Description":"","TrailerLink":"","TrailerEmbedCode":"","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"","RatingCount":2,"Rating":2.5,"CensorRating":"","ReleaseDate":"10/6/2011","Runtime":128,"Budget":0,"Revenue":0,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/91EC862CEFD594F760593A001FBCE4E7.jpg"},{"Id":"94c3aa05","ImdbId":"tt1727496","OriginalTitle":"Dil Toh Baccha Hai Ji","Title":"Dil Toh Baccha Hai Ji","Description":"Dil Toh Baccha Hai Ji is a 2011 Indian Hindi romantic comedy film directed by Madhur Bhandarkar, starring Ajay Devgn, Emraan Hashmi, Omi Vaidya, Shazahn Padamsee, Shruti Haasan and Shraddha Das in the lead roles.

It starts with an introduction to the lead actors, who live in Chandan Nagar Society. Each of the eight children has his own identity and a nickname based on these qualities. Akram is the fast bowler (Ramashankar), Encyclopedia is the mastermind (Arjun). Not only that, but their whole team has a nickname – CHILLAR PARTY. They explain that they have mainly two enemies with the 'over-sized' neighbouring cricket team to whom they always lose, and a dog to whom they have given a name – Loose Motion, since it has a tendency to make messes. So they develop an enmity against dogs. Their hopes are shattered shortly after a boy- Fatka who was employed for washing the cars of the society, enters with his dog Bhidu. They do everything to throw the boy and his dog out, but become unsuccessful. Eventually they develop a friendship with each other as Fatka helps them by serving as the lead bowler during the match with the neighbouring cricket team. But their happiness is short-lived when a reckless politician, welfare minister Shashikant Bhide, enters their life after his personal secretary is attacked by Bhidu for hurting Fatka.\r\n\r\nHe announces that in a news telecast, all the stray dogs roaming about in residential buildings in Mumbai will be caught and terminated and gives an excuse that it is done so that Mumbai becomes safer- and declares the slogan as \"Safe Mumbai and Safe Mumbaikar\". He further informs that the dog can only be saved if the society files a NO OBJECTION CERTIFICATE within 1 month. Chillar party, shocked by this, strives hard to get the NOC- wherein they have to get at least more than 50% votes of the total residents in the society i.e. 31 votes. But they manage only ten votes after 15 days.\r\n\r\nTo get more votes, they plan out few strategies but in vain. Finally organising a CHADDI MARCH- marching the streets with nothing on their body except underwears. They are telecast on TV and this gets them 10 more votes. With more hard work and awareness they manage to get another 10 votes counting a total of 30 votes. Only 1-day remains to complete the deadline of 1-month as declared by Bhide. Whilst all this chaos is going on, a t.v channel invites Bhide and the Chillar party for an interview. Seeing this as their last chance, they attend the interview which is being telecast to the whole India. Knowing that that is the last day and dog catchers are after Bhidu, they pray hard to save him. During the interview they are constantly mocked by Bhide and asked if all these dirty tricks and uncultured techniques were taught to them by the textbook. As he asks to stop the telecast, Silencer, who doesn't speak at all, speaks for the first time. He opens his text book and reads out loud \"We must always help others\" followed by others reading out \"A friend in need is a friend indeed\" and \"We must do what is right\". Overwhelmed by this the whole audience gives them a loud round of applause. Whilst in the society, dog catchers are already searching for Bhidu. The paper containing 30 votes is before the secretary, Mr. Tandon while he's watching the telecast. He resents Chillar party and is a close associate of minister Bhide. He was asked to give away Bhidu since this issue originated in his society. Chillar party pleads to leave and the interviewers agree. When they reach the society, they are disheartened as there is no sight of Bhidu. Suddenly Bhidu comes jumping in, wearing a collar reading \"Bhidu- Chandan Nagar Society\". While they were happy seeing Bhidu, they see the NOC on the desk with 31st sign – belonging to Tandon.","TrailerLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls7hxjVnHNQ","TrailerEmbedCode":"<iframe width=\"850\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ls7hxjVnHNQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Comedy","RatingCount":15,"Rating":3.75,"CensorRating":"U","ReleaseDate":"7/8/2011","Runtime":135,"Budget":8000000,"Revenue":65000000,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/2B4E60E19438994ECBC12CCC983F470A.jpg"},{"Id":"0946f343","ImdbId":"tt0016417","OriginalTitle":"Thank You","Title":"Thank You","Description":"Raj (Bobby Deol), Yogi (Sunil Shetty) and Vikram (Irrfan Khan) are best friends and business partners who are married to Sanjana (Sonam Kapoor), Maya (Celina Jaitley), and Shivani (Rimi Sen), respectively. What their wives don't know is that their husbands cheat on them often with not one, but many women.\r\n\r\nYogi has already been caught by Maya after the latter hired her new-found friend Kishan (Akshay Kumar), a private detective, to check on Yogi. Now Yogi's status in the marriage is reduced to that of a butler at home. Yet Yogi still has aspirations for more hanky panky if the right opportunity comes along. Vikram, on the other hand, maintains a strict hand on his wife and treats her condescendingly most of the time.\r\n\r\nRaj is in good shape, as Sanjana is quite gullible and suspects nothing. However, Sanjana finds out from Maya that the necklace that Raj had supposedly bought only for her actually was part of a buy one, get one free deal. Shivani, Maya, and Sanjana all get together to find the other, and Maya decides to hire Kishan to tail Raj.\r\n\r\nKishan has built his reputation as a man who saves marriages by getting erring husbands to mend their ways, and is also an expert in playing the flute. When he is first introduced to Sanjana, he seems to fall in love at first sight, or so it is made to appear at this point in the film. Initially a sceptical Sanjana rebukes Kishan's early attempts to prove that her husband is a lying cheat. This, however, only makes Kishan more determined.\r\n\r\nKishan first attempts to bring all the girlfriends of Raj, Vikram and Yogi to one party, at the same time when all the wives are there as well, to force a surprise face-off, thus exposing the cheating husbands. But Raj, with the help of Vikram and Yogi exclaiming them as the boyfriend, manages to lie his way out of the situation convincingly. Frustrated, but now even more determined, Kishan hatches a new plan, to break the friendship of the three men, by portraying Yogi as a traitor.\r\n\r\nRaj and Vikram, initially embarrassed, now become suspicious that someone is helping their wives behind the scenes, to ruin their marriages. They decide at this point to seek professional help and look to hire a private detective to find out who it is. In a twist of fate, they end up at Kishan's office. However, Kishan pretends he has no idea who they are, and chooses to play a double game, agreeing to act as their detective while unknown to them being the very person working for their wives that they are looking for.\r\n\r\nKishan now records Yogi talking to Sanjana in a park, hires a voice-over artist, and dubs the tape with Yogi now appearing (in the voice over) as if he is pouring out Raj and Vikram's secrets to Sanjana. Kishan then shows this altered version to Raj and Vikram, making them to feel betrayed by Yogi. However, as fate has it, they get a chance for revenge right away when Yogi calls and confides in them that he is off to see Sweetie, one of his old girlfriends, who is set to be married next month.\r\n\r\nRaj and Vikram are quick to reveal this information to Maya, as a result of which Yogi is caught red-handed by Maya, who goes ballistic at the site of Yogi in a hotel room with a girlfriend. Kishan also manages to humiliate Raj, catching him standing in his bathrobe outside an apartment building window ledge due to his girlfriend's husband unexpectedly showing up at the door inside. Kishan calls in the news channels and the police to get the stranded Raj broadcast live on TV. He then calls Sanjana, asking her to turn on the TV and see for herself what Raj is up to.\r\n\r\nCaught red-handed, Raj asks Vikram for help, the later comes up with a ploy to make it appear that both Raj and Vikram are undercover police officers in real life. And as such, Raj was out on a mission when caught on camera and that the whole resulting \"cheating husband outside window\" scenario shown on TV was actually all a misunderstanding. The gullible Sanjana wholeheartedly believes the story, much to Kishan's frustration.\r\n\r\nKishan now hatches his own counter-plot and pretends to be the gangster don, King, who is supposedly out to kill Raj and Vikram, thinking they are indeed police officers. When Raj and Vikram come face to face with King, they quickly backtrack on their story of being undercover police officers. However, King (Kishan) is able to scare Raj and Vikram into being blindfolded and taken as his prisoners. He then has them admitting, unknowingly in front of Sanjana and Shivani, that the whole secret agent thing is a fabrication and they have many girlfriends with whom they cheat on their wives regularly.\r\n\r\nSanjana and Shivani become extremely upset upon hearing these confessions, the latter fainting on the spot and Sanjana attempting suicide soon thereafter. However, Kishan rescues her and convinces her to work with him in a plan that will restore her marriage. The first step is for him to pretend to be Sanjana's new lover. He has Yogi give Raj and Vikram the information that Sanjana is now dating another man and loves him. The trio reunite and try ways to find out who this person is, nearly coming close to doing so on some occasions. Kishan also pretends to be Shivani's brother and the latter has Vikram tricked into signing over all his property to herself under the ruse of a bank document. Thus, Vikram is thrown out of his own house by Shivani and her family. He next convinces the trio that the real King is the man Sanjana is having an affair with. Since King's wife suspects him of having an affair, the trio are convinced to go to her and tell her everything. Along with her, they storm King's house and Raj then beats up King (Mukesh Tiwari) after the latter's wife has done so. However, this is revealed to be a misunderstanding as the woman with King at the time is not Sanjana, but somebody else.\r\n\r\nCompletely out of options, Raj, Vikram and Yogi go to Kishan's office. While there, they accidentally figure out that Kishan is, in fact, the person behind all the troubles they are in with their wives. When Kishan arrives, they quickly surround him with the intent to harm him, when all of a sudden Sanjana walks in. She is quick to defend Kishan, who had earlier saved her from committing suicide. At this point Raj decides to divorce Sanjana, mistakenly assuming she is in love with Kishan.\r\n\r\nSometime later, with the divorce finalised, Raj, Vikram and Yogi are found drunk at a lake-side restaurant, when Kishan appears all of a sudden. He has with him some cards inviting the three over to a wedding. Raj assumes it is Kishan and Sanjana's wedding, and starts to chase Kishan. Since he is drunk, he keeps missing and Vikram then accidentally smashes a police officer. The three friends are then arrested, and put in jail. Where they reminisce about the tragedy that has befallen them. But the next morning, they are bailed out by the don King, much to their surprise.\r\n\r\nOut of jail, and armed with a gun supplied by King, Raj, full of rage, heads straight for the wedding and straight away shoots Kishan, supposedly killing him on the spot. However, it turns out, the bullets were all fake blanks, planted by King in collaboration with Kishan himself. Kishan gets up and reveals that the wedding was actually supposed to be between Sanjana and the surprise groom, Raj himself, much to the embarrassment of Raj.\r\n\r\nIt becomes clear at this point that Kishan was never after Sanjana herself as has been made to appear throughout the film. But that Kishan did all this because he himself once had a wife (Vidya Balan), who committed suicide after finding out that Kishan was cheating on her. From that day on, Kishan decided to become a private detective going around saving marriages in crisis, like his own. After this emotional revelation, Raj, Yogi and Vikram promise to give up outside-relationships. All the couples get back together, Raj and Sanjana get remarried.","TrailerLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fyes_DaF-w","TrailerEmbedCode":"<iframe width=\"850\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2fyes_DaF-w\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Comedy","RatingCount":10,"Rating":2.3,"CensorRating":"U/A","ReleaseDate":"4/8/2011","Runtime":125,"Budget":580000000,"Revenue":700000000,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/6FEB48D8C2051AEA46C3535FF7EF4D35.jpg"},{"Id":"0e8b2552","ImdbId":"tt1839596","OriginalTitle":"Rockstar","Title":"Rockstar","Description":"Rockstar is a 2011 Indian musical romantic drama film directed by Imtiaz Ali, starring Ranbir Kapoor and debutant Nargis Fakhri, with music composed by A.

It is a remake of the 2008 Telugu film, Ready directed by Sreenu Vaitla starring Ram and Genelia. The songs are composed by Pritam, while the background score is composed by Sandeep Shirodkar. The first look was unveiled on 5 April 2011, while the theatrical trailer was released on 15 April 2011. The film was released on 3 June 2011. Upon release, Ready became the second highest opening-day grosser, as well as the second highest weekend grossing Bollywood film, after Dabangg, another Salman Khan-starrer. It holds the record for being second highest grossing Bollywood film of 2011. The story synopsis is as follows...\r\n\r\nReady starts with ready-witted Prem (Salman Khan) helping his childhood friend Khushi (Zarine Khan) to elope with Raju (Ajay Devgn). Khushi's intended bridegroom Gaurav (Arbaaz Khan) reveals that he also has a girlfriend, Kiran (Kangana Ranaut), whom he wants to marry. The elopement angers Khushi's father, Mr. Pathak (Mithilesh Chaturvedi) and Prem's family, the Kapoors. Prem manages to pacify his family members.\r\n\r\nThe Kapoors decide to get Prem engaged to Pooja. Prem is sent to receive Pooja at the airport; however, he deliberately goes to the wrong terminal to avoid meeting her. A young woman named Sanjana (Asin), who has just run away from her own wedding, overhears Prem telling his uncle about ditching Pooja. Since nobody from Prem's family has ever seen Pooja, Sanjana pretends to be Prem's intended fiancée. Sanjana, posing as Pooja, goes to stay with the Kapoors and wins the hearts of the entire family, except Prem, who gets irritated with her.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Sanjana's maternal uncles, Amar Choudhary (Akhilendra Mishra) and Suraj Choudhary (Sharat Saxena), who are rivals, try to search for her. Each uncle wants Sanjana to marry his respective brother-in-law to inherit her wealth. Sanjana and Prem escape from Suraj Chaudhary's goons by taking a lift in the car of Mr. Lehri (Sudesh Lehri). Prem outwits the goons and sends Suraj's son Aryan into a coma while escaping. Suraj Choudhary takes the help of Mr. Lehri to get to know who ran away with Sanjana.\r\n\r\nBy then, Prem finds out Sanjana's true identity, and she tells him about her uncles trying to get her married. Prem and Sanjana fall in love and decide to marry. However, her uncle Suraj Chaudhary takes her away. Then the Kapoors come to know about her true identity; they still want her as Prem's wife. Prem assures Sanjana that she should stay with her uncle, and he will find a way to marry her as well as reunite her whole family.\r\n\r\nPrem pretends to be the nephew of Balidaan Bhardwaaj a.k.a. Bali (Paresh Rawal), a chartered accountant who serves Sanjana's uncles. Prem convinces Suraj and Amar Chaudhary not to get either of their brothers-in-law married to Sanjana. Instead, he suggests the daughters of America's billionaires K.K. and B.K. Modi as suitable brides for the two brothers-in-law. What the Choudharies do not know is that K.K. and B.K. Modi are actually Prem's dad and uncle in disguise. Prem gets the rest of his family to play characters to trick Sanjana's family into letting her marry him. He also manages to change the Chaudhary family's negative attitudes.\r\n\r\nBut on the wedding day, Aryan recovers from his coma, and reveals the truth about Prem. A physical fight follows, in which Prem gets the upper hand of Sanjana's uncles and their men. He then explains to Amar and Suraj how Sanjana's late mother wanted them to unite and get their niece married. The Chaudharies realise their mistake and are deeply apologetic for their behaviour. In the end, Prem and Sanjana get married and their wedding picture is taken with the Kapoors and Chaudharies, a.k.a. the 'Chapoors'. In the end, a spinoff is placed for a sequel in the future as the third brother of the Chauderies returns.","TrailerLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACvDgKuTxnA","TrailerEmbedCode":"<iframe width=\"850\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ACvDgKuTxnA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Comedy","RatingCount":10,"Rating":2.35,"CensorRating":"U/A","ReleaseDate":"6/3/2011","Runtime":145,"Budget":40000000,"Revenue":18400000,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/87952F3E090A53D59638A5E86C19D93C.jpg"},{"Id":"7a06c70c","ImdbId":"tt1937092","OriginalTitle":"Always Kabhi Kabhi","Title":"Always Kabhi Kabhi","Description":"Always Kabhi Kabhi (meaning 'Always Sometimes') is a 2011 Hindi romance film directed by Roshan Abbas, and produced by Shahrukh Khan under Red Chillies Entertainment.

To impress his sceptical son Prateek (Verma), and upon the request of his wife Sonia (Kapoor), Shekhar uses his son's idea that the antagonist should be more powerful than the protagonist. His colleague, computer programmer Jenny (Goswami), uses Shekhar's face as a model for that of the game's protagonist G.One (Technically Good One and in Hindi Jeevan, which means life), while the shape-shifting antagonist Ra.One (Technically Random Access Version One and in Hindi Ravan, a mythical demon)[3] is made faceless. Another colleague, Akashi (Wu), implements the characters' movements. The game, named Ra.One, contains three levels, the final level being the only one in which either character can be killed. Each character possesses a special device – the H.A.R.T (Hertz Amplifying Resonance Transmitter) which gives them their powers. Upon reaching the last level, the characters gain a gun with one bullet; the other character can be killed by this bullet but only if his H.A.R.T is attached.\r\n\r\nWhen Ra.One undergoes final tests, Akashi notices unusual glitches but chooses to ignore them. When the game is officially launched, it receives a standing ovation from the audience; an enamored Prateek insists on playing it immediately. He logs in under the ID Lucifer and proceeds to the second level, but is interrupted by Akashi. Ra.One, unable to end his turn with Lucifer and angry that a player has proceeded so far, becomes determined that Lucifer will die. He uses a wireless technology (which Jenny had introduced in a conference) to enter the real world, a process which causes the mainframe to malfunction. Akashi informs Shekhar, who partially understands the situation and rushes home, fearing for his son's life. Meanwhile, Ra.One kills Akashi and assumes his form; he goes to find Lucifer, and meets Shekhar in the process. In an attempt to save his son, Shekhar claims that he is Lucifer, but his lie is exposed when Ra.One scans his identity card. Consequently, Ra.One kills Shekhar and makes it look like a car accident.\r\n\r\nSonia, devastated after Shekhar's death, tells Prateek that the family will return to India after Shekhar's funeral. A suspicious Prateek notices digital patterns on the fateful road and realises that Ra.One has come to life. He convinces Jenny of the same when they see the destroyed game laboratory, and the latter tries to bring G.One into the real world. Meanwhile, Ra.One chases the family on their way to the airport, but G.One enters the real world and causes a gas explosion which temporarily destroys Ra.One. G.One takes Ra.One's H.A.R.T. and accompanies the family to Mumbai after Sonia realises that she needs him.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, Ra.One returns to life, takes the form of a billboard model (Rampal), and tracks down G.One to Prateek's birthday party. Hypnotising Sonia, he assumes her form to kidnap Prateek. Ra.One then instructs G.One to give him his H.A.R.T. back, and sends the real Sonia in a malfunctioning local train. The train crashes into the Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus, but G.One saves Sonia in time. To save Prateek, he returns to the virtual world and fights Ra.One; both reach the third level, the former left with little power. G.One tricks Ra.One into shooting him without his H.A.R.T. attached, leaving Ra.One helpless; furious, the latter creates ten copies of himself. Prateek, unable to identify the real Ra.One, asks G.One to quote Shekhar: \"If you join the forces of evil, its shadows shall always follow you\". The pair realise that only one of the ten Ra.Ones has a shadow: the original one. G.One shoots and destroys him, absorbs Ra.One's remains and disappears.\r\n\r\nSix months later, Prateek and Sonia return to London, where the former manages to restore G.One to the real world.","TrailerLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBud7byobX0","TrailerEmbedCode":"<iframe width=\"850\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pBud7byobX0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Action","RatingCount":10,"Rating":2.4,"CensorRating":"U/A","ReleaseDate":"10/26/2011","Runtime":156,"Budget":1300000000,"Revenue":2400000000,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/C53116E153DFADD64D3E865B7ADCE384.jpg"},{"Id":"9226175e","ImdbId":"tt1285241","OriginalTitle":"Don 2","Title":"Don 2","Description":"Having conquered the Asian underworld, crime boss Don (Shah Rukh Khan) sets in motion a plan that will give him dominion over Europe.","TrailerLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xuAwJReL88","TrailerEmbedCode":"<iframe width=\"850\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9xuAwJReL88\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Action","RatingCount":15,"Rating":3.55,"CensorRating":"U/A","ReleaseDate":"12/23/2011","Runtime":148,"Budget":0,"Revenue":2150000000,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/D80BD913621548B990F713C1862C5C46.jpg"},{"Id":"4e7d6459","ImdbId":"tt1848771","OriginalTitle":"Aarakshan","Title":"Aarakshan","Description":"A decision by India's supreme court polarizes students and staff at a college in Bhopal.","TrailerLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBkpQekqOI8","TrailerEmbedCode":"<iframe width=\"850\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lBkpQekqOI8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Action","RatingCount":13,"Rating":3.1,"CensorRating":"U/A","ReleaseDate":"8/12/2011","Runtime":164,"Budget":0,"Revenue":0,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/06B31CE812A1806D519C66A0C796E7AC.jpeg"},{"Id":"6a82c73f","ImdbId":"tt1869296","OriginalTitle":"Bbuddah Hoga Terra Baap","Title":"Bbuddah Hoga Terra Baap","Description":"Kabir, the mastermind of a series of bomb blasts, wants to get rid of the officer investigating the case, so he hires an assassin who is an ex-convict and a former gangster.","TrailerLink":"","TrailerEmbedCode":"","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Action","RatingCount":10,"Rating":2.8,"CensorRating":"U/A","ReleaseDate":"7/1/2011","Runtime":0,"Budget":0,"Revenue":0,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/C4A09331723C241EFBE6F625F4210832.jpeg"},{"Id":"e76c2b7f","ImdbId":"tt1667076","OriginalTitle":"F.A.L.T.U.","Title":"FALTU","Description":"Three loser friends create a fake university to avoid working for their parents.","TrailerLink":"","TrailerEmbedCode":"","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Comedy","RatingCount":10,"Rating":2.25,"CensorRating":"U/A","ReleaseDate":"4/1/2011","Runtime":0,"Budget":0,"Revenue":0,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/A6789F30201DCECBDDDBC6B6ED3BEE5E.jpeg"}]
