The Chinese feel they can use these circumstances to brand him as an Indian Spy and use this political leverage to embarrass the Indian Government and create an International fracus. The Indian Government feels that under such politically unfavourable circumstances, the Chinese will not accept any proof of Karan having crashed during a routine training so they order the Army to erase Karan's army record, identities and simply deny his existence. Due to this Karan has to suffer inhuman torture from Chinese army for one year in a bid to force a confession out of him.\r\n\r\nHowever, as Karan still refuses to relent, he is transferred to be tried at the Chinese Military Court with the most probable and possible sentence being the death penalty.

Finding himself outnumbered and outgunned, Karanvir jumps off the bridge into the fast flowing river with Simrit after kicking AK on his face. After flowing along the river for some distance, they climb to the banks and end up inside the forest. AK's power, position and respect from ordinary people of Dilerkot is largely attributed to fear-tactics efficiently used by him. After being publicly humiliated by Karan, AK senses that this act of Karan would affect his fear among people negatively, he declares that within one day he would track him down alive and hang him in the middle of marketplace in Dilkerkot. In the meantime AK kills a visibly frightened onlooker who laughs at AK's failure to capture Karanvir on the bridge. In the forest, Karan hears Simrit's story and promises to help her.

The next morning AK74 hires special trackers and sets out along hunting dogs. AK spots a torn piece of Simrit's shirt. The hunting dogs thus get a scent of the duo and tracks them down. Karan misleads the dogs and crosses a river and the dogs lose them. Karan and simrit get outnumbered and Karan is shot in his stomach.

David is Ghani's protege who is poised to take over the empire one day as Ghani's son is a spoilt, playful brat. David is in love with Ghani's ward, Noor and promises to marry her. Things take a turn when two undercover RAW agents come to London to expose Ghani's ties to religious extremists in India. While trying to take David down, the agents reveal to him that his mother was Ghani's mistress and might have killed his father to be with him. David's loyalty towards his master is tested even more when Noor is forcefully married off to Ghani's son to hide the fact he is gay even though she is pregnant with David's son. When the RAW agents finally manage to get close to Ghani, they assassinate not only him but David as well to keep their mission a secret from the British authorities.\r\n\r\nMumbai, 1999: 19-year-old David (Vinay Virmani) is an amateur guitarist born into a family of lower-middle class Christians. He is a happy go lucky teenager who dreams of becoming a professional musician and sending his sisters off to Dubai to pursue their dreams. Their father, Noel, a Protestant priest rallies the locals to do charity work for those in need. A Hindu fanatic politician, Malati Tai, finds out about this and makes it appear as if David's father is converting poor people to Christianity in return for money. She attacks David's colony with the help of gangsters and humiliates Noel by blackening his face in front of the media. Traumatised by this, the priest starts to lose his mind. An angry David is then easily persuaded by a political activist to assassinate Malati at a rally to seek vengeance. However, the plan is foiled when an unknown gunman fails to assassinate Malati and instead kills the army officer standing next to her.\r\n\r\nGoa, 2010: 30-year-old David (Vikram) is an alcoholic fisherman living in the small fishing village of Betul in Goa. He falls in love with the deaf and mute Roma (Isha Sharvani) â€“ the only hitch is that she is engaged to be married to his best friend Peter in 10 days. When he finds out Peter does not really love her but is only marrying her for her wealthy father's boat which he will receive as dowry, David is coaxed by his friend, Frenny to stop the wedding. However, David comes to realise that his intentions might not be sincere as both his mother and the priest who tries to help him stop the wedding become involved in separate accidents and are hospitalised. On the day of the wedding, David plans to profess his love for Roma until Peter reveals that he actually sincerely loves her and was only lying that he was marrying her for the dowry out of fear he would be teased. David decides not to stop the wedding.\r\n\r\nGradually, it is revealed that all three Davids are connected somehow in the turn of events. In 1999, the London David's son with Noor, Iqbal, comes to Mumbai to seek revenge for his father's murder. The army officer killed at Malati Tai's rally is actually one of the corrupt RAW agents who Iqbal shoots down with intent. Witnessing the shooting makes the Mumbai David realise what he almost became had he succeeded in assassinating Malati. He then moves to Goa and becomes a priest. In 2010, he is the priest that marries off Peter to Roma. Realising that the Goan David would have spoken out against the wedding, he praises the Goan David for not doing so after the ceremony.","TrailerLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmOBx6jS3Fc","TrailerEmbedCode":"<iframe width=\"850\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fmOBx6jS3Fc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Drama","RatingCount":13,"Rating":3.1,"CensorRating":"U/A","ReleaseDate":"2/1/2013","Runtime":160,"Budget":10000000,"Revenue":37500000,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/6F234780C65DB984ECDE9C3BB5C4EABB.jpg"},{"Id":"ec9633c4","ImdbId":"tt2318401","OriginalTitle":"Bandook","Title":"Bandook","Description":"Bandook is a 2013 Bollywood crime film starring Aditya Om, Manisha Kelkar and Arshad Khan as lead characters.The film is directed and produced by Aditya Om and Mohammed M.K.

The abductors evade the police and take Calculus to the Andes mountains. Tintin and Haddock pursue them to the mountain town of Jauga, where they board a train that is sabotaged in an attempt to kill them.

Dilip lives in the slums around the plant with his wife, a son and his sister. He gets a job in the plant as a labourer, and is happy since his daily wage is restored.\r\n\r\nThe plant witnesses a drop in its revenue due to lower sales of pesticides, and in order to reduce the loss the officials neglect safety and maintenance. Questioning the chemicals used in the plant, Motwani (Kal Penn), a tabloid reporter publishes reports in his makeshift printing press which are disregarded by most of the officials and workers. Roy (Joy Sengupta), the in-charge for the safety of the plant expresses his concerns. The officials however ignore his warnings, and a worker is killed when methyl isocyanate leaking from a pipeline drips off on his hand. The officials deem the worker's irresponsibility as the cause of the accident and the plant continues to function. Dilip is given a better-paying vacant job in the plant despite lacking the skill to operate machinery. A gas leak is prevented by Roy when water is mixed with methyl isocyanate, and in an attempt to stop people from panicking, the official in the plant sabotages the warning siren.\r\n\r\nWarren Anderson (Martin Sheen), the CEO of Union Carbide, visits the plant to inspect its functionality, where he is briefed about a plan to connect two additional tanks for storage of methyl isocyanate to increase the output of the plant, ignoring the deteriorated condition of the tanks. Motwani meanwhile meets Eva Gascon (Mischa Barton), a reporter in the Paris Match, and persuades her to get an interview of Anderson. She impersonates the identity of an Associated Press reporter, but fails as her true identity is exposed in between the interview. Motwani convinces Dilip of the danger posed by the chemicals.\r\n\r\nAs the date of the disaster nears, Dilip arranges a loan for the wedding of his sister. Roy later explains how the company is ignoring safety standards, and that how a future leak might become uncontrolled as the officials had turned off safety measures to reduce the maintenance costs. Roy gives his resignation to the company and advises Dilip not to talk about the plant's safety if he wishes to retain his job. Dilip makes a phone call to Motwani describing what Roy just said, and expresses his fear about the plant's safety, saying he will return to the rickshaw-pulling business as soon as his sister is married.\r\n\r\nIn order to overcome the increasing revenue loss, the officials shut down the plant, firing most of the workers, including Dilip. The plant officials then order the usage of the remaining methyl isocyanate as soon as possible. Meanwhile Dilip is busy with the wedding of his sister, and Roy has a final look of the control room. The safety measures fail and a runaway reaction follows. The faulty tanks cause the gas to start leaking, and an attempt to contain the leak fails. The gas escapes to the surroundings and is carried east by the wind. Motwani rushes to alert the people in the vicinity of the plant to vacate and head west, since the warning sirens were previously sabotaged. He meets Dilip, who ignores the warning and asks Motwani to leave the area without causing any hindrance to the wedding. Meanwhile the guests experience irritation in the eyes and discomfort in breathing. Dilip senses the danger and visits the plant, realising that the plant had been compromised. He rushes back to his residence where he finds his family and relatives succumbing to the toxic gas. He carries away his son, paying farewell to his wife's corpse and flees the slum.\r\n\r\nAs the gas shows its effects, a nearby hospital is filled with hundreds of patients reporting cyanide poisoning, and the lack of antidote results in most of the patients' death. Dilip, in the last of his energy, throws away his Union Carbide identity badge, rests his son on the ground and succumbs to the toxic gas. The story jumps to the present day, where a blind boy is holding Dilip's identity badge, and the film ends with Motwani narrating the words \"Whatever may be the cause of the disaster, Carbide never left Bhopal\". A photo montage depicts the aftermath of the disaster, and pictures of the characters and their real-life counterparts","TrailerLink":"","TrailerEmbedCode":"","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Action","RatingCount":1,"Rating":2.0,"CensorRating":"U/A","ReleaseDate":"10/18/2013","Runtime":96,"Budget":0,"Revenue":0,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/02A8E6F82B7E8A410F13151250D14ACB.jpg"},{"Id":"740a5ef1","ImdbId":"tt2872256","OriginalTitle":"NH4","Title":"NH4","Description":"Prabhu Sivaanu (Siddharth) and his friends discuss the route from Bangalore to Chennai and plan to kidnap Rithika (Ashrita Shetty).

So, on Zafar's insistence, Pandit takes them to meet a local gangster, Bholi Punjaban (Richa Chadda) where Hunny tells them their scheme.

She was married off in an arranged marriage at age 11, and widowed shortly thereafter. The story of the film revolves around her wedding jewels, which she keeps sequestered in a box. After becoming a victim of ethnic cleansing during the partition of India, her family moves to the Republic of India from East Pakistan, losing their ancestral lands in the process. She spends the remainder of her life, apparently as a chaste widow, hiding her wedding jewels from her greedy relatives in the joint family. In 1949, she befriends the new bride of the family, her niece-in-law (Konkona Sen Sharma) shortly before dying.\r\n\r\nThe niece-in-law is visited by the spirit of the matriarch, who demands that she hide the jewelry box from her greedy relatives. Over the years, the family descends into poverty, losing money in judicial proceedings over family property disputes, while the niece in law, regularly monitored by the spirit of the matriarch, keeps the jewels hidden. Eventually, the spirit of the matriarch allows the niece-in-law to pawn some of the jewels so that her husband (Saswata Chatterjee) can set up a business, over the objections of the family, selling saris . The prosperity of the business allows her to buy the jewels back, completing the hidden collection. The niece-in-law discovers that her husband is having an extramarital affair, and complains to the ghost of the matriarch. The ghost of the matriarch regales her with a story of a torrid sexual liaison that she had with a labourer when she was alive and young, and encourages the niece in law to take on a lover of her own. The niece-in-law at first falls in love with the secret lover but later she returns to her husband and gives birth to a girl. The ghost failing to succeed in her endeavor of uniting the niece in law and her lover abandons the niece in law and begins to visit her daughter, the ghost's grandniece instead.\r\n\r\nThe final part of the film revolves around the daughter as she grows up (Srabanti Chatterjee) and becomes a modern Bengali Indian woman; going to college, driving, and becoming involved in politics.

The daughter's lover regularly crosses the border over to East Pakistan to aid the Mukti Bahini rebels in their struggle for freedom. The 1971 Bangladesh genocide becomes a backdrop of the film, and one of the rebels is murdered by a Pakistani death squad, following which the ghost of the matriarch advises the daughter to donate the jewels to the cause of the Mukti Bahini.","TrailerLink":"","TrailerEmbedCode":"","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Action","RatingCount":1,"Rating":2.0,"CensorRating":"U/A","ReleaseDate":"4/11/2013","Runtime":141,"Budget":0,"Revenue":0,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/D7A3232A036B6AEDCA16866CA02B3031.jpg"},{"Id":"d41d6a91","ImdbId":"tt2832540","OriginalTitle":"Daddy Cool Munde Fool","Title":"Daddy Cool Munde Fool","Description":"Widower Parminder Singh Puppy is worried about the future of his careless and spoilt sons Gunny and Manni.

Shukla (Avtar Sahni) runs a photo studio, which in reality is an undercover agency employing a collection of young petty thieves who work the streets committing petty crime.\r\n\r\nThe story revolves around Satbir (Deepak Dobriyal), one of the young thieves who wants to get out of the life of crime and become a good citizen. In his attempts to find normal employment, he stumbles across a young attractive woman Neena (Priya Bathija), whom he then attempts to court. When his friends from the agency notice his new love interest, they steal Neena's purse in the mall where Satbir is now working. Satbir gets the purse back and returns it to Neena the next time they meet.\r\n\r\nWhen Neena discovers that Satbir knows some petty thieves personally, she is very curious to meet some. She promises Satbir to spend the day with him on the streets of Delhi, if he can show her some of the action. Satbir thinks about the offer, but has misgivings about the idea of letting an outsider onto the inner workings of the petty crime scene. However, the temptation of Neena's company is too strong to resist, and he agrees. But Satbir does not know that Neena works at the local TV station as an investigative reporter.\r\n\r\nNeena then disappears and Satbir next sees her on the local TV channel in an ad announcing next week's investigative report on street crime in Delhi. Much to his horror, the ad also features Satbir himself, who has been secretly recorded all day as he goes about town showing Neena various incidents of petty crime taking place. Satbir now realizes that he has been set-up by Neena and as a result of his folly, all of his friends are going to be exposed to the public on TV.\r\n\r\nAs a result, Satbir has to go into hiding, but he is soon caught by Shukla and brought to the studio, where he explains his innocence. While he is forgiven for his folly, that does not really help the cause of the gang, who now face public humiliation and likely arrest. Satbir vows to Shukla that 'no matter what, the TV episode will not air next week.'\r\n\r\nThings, however, look grim for the small street gang trying to take down a nationally advertised ready-to-run episode off the air with only a week to go. But Satbir has an inspiration, that leads to a plan which revolves around creating doubt in the TV station manager's mind about the authenticity of Neena's recordings.\r\n\r\nTo make the plan work, the gang first break into the TV station and steal a copy of the recording that is going to be aired. They then cut each of the several incidents of street theft in the recording and repackage them as part of a false reality TV show called \"Chor, Chor, Super Chor\". After each incident, the gang (masquerading as a TV crew) is now shown going to the home of the victim and returning the stolen items along with a \"surprise you are on TV\" ending. So what was originally footage of several incidents of petty street theft, now resembles a series of episodes of a reality TV show where the \"supposed\" petty theft is followed by a visit to the victim and a happy ending.\r\n\r\nTo make this work more effectively, the gang tracks down the manager of the TV station and robs him off his car on the street in an elaborately planned scam. Recording the event on camera all this time, they then show up outside the TV station later in the day, pretending to be a TV crew. They then proceed to return the car to the TV manager as he finally arrives to work after his long frustrating day on the streets of Delhi.\r\n\r\nInitially, the manager is upset and confused, more so since he has never heard of the reality show \"Chor, Chor, Super Chor\". The crew explain that they are new on the scene and are in fact looking for a station that would want to air the show. The manager, unaware that the crew are actual petty criminals in real life, is impressed with their performance.\r\n\r\nHe invites Satbir and the crew inside. Once in his office, the crew is able to convince him that Neena is a fraud and her entire episode on street crime was supposedly their own film work which she must have stolen from them. She is accused of having cut-up their work and then passed it off to the station manager as real investigative reporting. The manager is initially skeptical of their claim, but is convinced in the end since he himself has just been the victim of the supposed show's prank. He now decides to abort the airing of the report.\r\n\r\nThe manager now fires Neena and hires the crew and their reality show instead. The show becomes a big hit across Delhi. In a bizarre and ironic twist, petty crime, instead of going down as Neena hoped, goes up across the city as people on the street become openly receptive to being robbed of their possessions, hoping the person robbing them is perhaps part of the TV show and will show up at their door later on with a prize and a chance to be on national tv.","TrailerLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLFIT_M9m9w","TrailerEmbedCode":"<iframe width=\"850\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eLFIT_M9m9w\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Action","RatingCount":14,"Rating":3.35,"CensorRating":"U/A","ReleaseDate":"8/2/2013","Runtime":99,"Budget":0,"Revenue":0,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/75177B4C293310DAD42FF565CA18C4B1.JPG"},{"Id":"44e5016a","ImdbId":"tt2522290","OriginalTitle":"Four Two Ka One","Title":"Four Two Ka One","Description":"This comedy caper revolves around a mystery bag stolen by one of the characters in the film.

Harry (Pankaj Kapur), his daughter, Bijlee Mandola (Anushka Sharma) and Hukum Singh Matru (Imran Khan) known in short as 'Matru'. Harry is a wealthy, cynical businessman who dreams of turning the Mandola village (named after his family) into a shining example of his success and a microcosm of a fledgeling economy in itself. But this dream can only be realised if the villagers agree to sell their land to the government at unfairly low rates in order for the land to be converted into a Special Economic Zone.\r\n\r\nWhile being the shrewd, sophisticated and composed individual that Harry normally is, he is also quite fond of drinking. Whenever drunk, he turns into the advocate of equality and betterment of the villagers, but regrets these thoughts and deeds when sober. When he chooses not to drink he hallucinates, as a withdrawal symptom, about a pink buffalo 'Gulabo', the mascot of the brand of alcohol that he enjoys. The knowledge of these hallucinations are later used by Matru as a ploy to get Harry drunk in order to serve his own plans.\r\n\r\nBijlee Mandola is the only child of Harry Mandola. She lost her mother when she was young and now lives in Mandola village after having received a higher education in New Delhi and later in Oxford, England. Bijlee is now in love with Baadal (Arya Babbar), the son of a politician Chaudhari Devi (Shabana Azmi) and is all set to marry him.\r\n\r\nChaudhari Devi is a corrupt politician who, along with her obedients, is helping Harry realise his dream. Baadal and Bijlee's union is strategically apt as it serves Harry's and Chaudhari Devi's personal goals. While Chaudhari Devi conspires to control Harry's wealth by marrying her son to his daughter, Harry seeks Chaudhari Devi's help in realising his dream in exchange for their children's marriage.\r\n\r\nMatru is a revolutionary, fighting for the villagers' cause of not letting their land being taken away. He is educated in Law from JNU, holds a job as Harry's driver and is responsible for regulating Harry's drinking. Matru's revolutionary instincts are shown to be significantly influenced by those of Mao Tse Tung.\r\n\r\nThe film starts with a negotiation at a liquor shop set in crop laden fields, between the liquor shop owner and a heavily drunk Harry. The shop owner's rude refusal to sell alcohol to Harry due to the day being a dry day, provokes Harry to run his Limousine into the shop.\r\n\r\nOnce drunk, Harry is shown to be an entirely different individual, who wants the land of the villagers to be returned to them, Matru to marry Bijlee while himself to retire into a religious man.\r\n\r\nThe villagers, in their fight are supported and advised by Mao who regularly sends messages to the villagers, written on cloth. Later in the film it is revealed that Mao is none other than Matru who is advising the villagers without revealing himself in order to retain the key position as Harry's aide.\r\n\r\nBijlee's love for Baadal is depicted to be a contradiction to her subtle, probably subconscious, knowledge of Baadal's incompatibility with her. This subtle thought aggravated by Baadal's affiliation and acts supporting his mother's corrupt cause, overpowers Bijlee's will to marry him and polarises her into helping Matru and the villagers instead. After this polarisation, seeing Chaudhari Devi and Baadal's ambitions now with more clarity and while helping Matru and the villagers, Bijlee falls in love with Matru.\r\n\r\nAlthough they have the help of Matru, his college friends and Bijlee, the villagers lose their entire harvest to an unexpected rain storm. This harvest, which would have fetched enough money to settle their debts to the government bank and still some more for their own survival, is now completely destroyed. Thus the villagers are forced to surrender their land, against their will, to the government in order to settle their debts.\r\n\r\nLater, discovering Bijlee's alliance with the villagers, Chaudhari Devi, now cautious, decides to finalise the decree to convert the now acquired land into an SEZ only once Bijlee and Baadal are married.\r\n\r\nAll this builds up the tension leading up to the wedding at the climax wherein Matru and the villagers have a plan to get Harry drunk who will then call off the wedding. This plan apparently works and Harry is shown to be drunk, succumbing to Matru and the villagers' plan. Now while drunk, he enters the wedding venue, calls off the wedding, chases away Chaudhari Devi, Baadal and their supporters and decides to get Bijlee and Matru married. Consequently, upon refusal by Matru on the pretext that Harry will not feel the same way about him and Bijlee when sober, Harry, to everyone's surprise, reveals that he had sworn on Bijlee to not consume even a drop of alcohol and has stood by his word, in turn revealing that while he did all that he did appearing to be drunk, he wasn't drunk at all in the first place.","TrailerLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0FFsm7qyjc","TrailerEmbedCode":"<iframe width=\"850\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/o0FFsm7qyjc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Action","RatingCount":12,"Rating":2.9,"CensorRating":"U/A","ReleaseDate":"1/11/2013","Runtime":151,"Budget":450000000,"Revenue":425000000,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/E7ED5B23105681B9528B7338860B2B4D.jpeg"},{"Id":"a6d31412","ImdbId":"tt2814372","OriginalTitle":"Gippi","Title":"Gippi","Description":"Gippi is a 14-year-old girl who lives in Shimla with her mother Pappi and little brother Booboo.

They take all of them out and kill them mercilessly. A little girl tries to escape, but is shot and killed immediately.\r\n\r\nThe movie then moves to Kasauli, where a bearded man, Vikram Singh (John Abraham) wakes up after having visions of men getting killed. He then finds on TV that the Sri Lankan Prime Minister is killed by a human bomb. He purchases a bottle of liquor and goes to a nearby church. The priest of that church, who seems to know him for the past three years, asks him about his \"conspiracy\" when he says that \"Our Prime Minister could have been saved from the conspiracy\". The bearded man then starts narrating his story.\r\n\r\nThe film then goes five years back, when the man tells that the continuous battle between the majority in Sri Lanka Sinhalese and minorities Tamils had reached a dangerous level. In that battle thousands of Tamils lost their lives, causing their youths to take weapons in their hands and join the LTF leader Anna Bhaskaran (a character based on the real-life LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran). Due to the plight of Tamils there, the Indian Prime Minister (Sanjay Gurubaxani) decided to sign a peace accord with Sri Lankan Government and said that the elections should happen there peacefully before Diwali. However, Anna refused to accept the accord and the Indian Peace Keeping Forces were forced to withdraw from the island. A heated meeting in New Delhi between the Indian officials leads Robin Dutt aka RD (Siddharth Basu), the R&AW chief, to call upon his best man, Maj. Vikram Singh to find out the solution.\r\n\r\nAfter meeting and discussing the strategy with RD and his deputy, Swaroop (Avijit Dutt) Vikram travels to Sri Lanka and meets a war correspondent Jaya Sahni (Nargis Fakhri) and tries to find out a way to stop the rebels. After reporting to his senior Bala (Prakash Belwadi) he tries to find some that may help to find Shri, the only man who can withstand and oppose Anna. After meeting with an informer called Narayanan, Vikram manages to visit Shri. Vikram promises Shri to help him rise against Anna by providing him with arms. The arms deal date is decided at 6 July. However, the deal goes terribly wrong and one of Vikram's associates is killed in a surprise attack by LTF. Bala scolds Vikram of his working style and tells him to go to Colombo Safehouse. Vikram meets Jaya to seek her help. Jaya tells him that they know his next step even before he implement it. However, she tells him that \"a foreign agency guy met with an Indian official\" before her arrival in the island. Next day, Vasu, Bala's associate, meets a man, gives him a photo of Vikram, telling him \"to keep him alive\".\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, RD and his team is shocked to learn on TV that Vikram is kidnapped by LTF. However, he is left alive by LTF, but badly wounded. Bala visits him in the hospital and tells him to leave Sri Lanka as he is on the hit-list of both the camps. Vikram feels suspicious about Bala. He calls SP, one of his associates, and tells him to report all activities of Bala to him. Vikram, posing as a war correspondent, manages to reach Malaya, second in-command of Anna and persuades him to meet RD in Colombo. RD tells him that the only way this war could be won is by a political solution. He instigates Malaya to stand up as the only champion of his people, thus dividing the LTF in two. Vikram and Indian forces then launch a massive attack on the LTF base camp where Anna and his men (minus Malaya) were discussing strategy. A devastating gunbattle begins, and Vikram escapes from the island after being told by RD. Everyone believes Anna got killed in the fight. However, Anna survives and later kills Malaya and Shri. In the light of the resurfaced violence, the Indian Prime Minister resigns. Some months later, SP later tracks some discussion of Anna over the phone and tells Bala about this, but Bala tells him to ignore them, causing SP to believe that Bala might be a mole. He escapes with the intercepts and files of the case. Bala finds about it and burns the remaining papers, later telling someone over the phone that SP and Vikram are in Kochi and he should send some men there. Vikram later receives a call from SP who tells him to meet him. After meeting with SP, Vikram comes home to find Ruby (Rashi Khanna), his wife, murdered. Vikram's associate in Kochi, Kush tells him that Vasu has been tracked. He nabs Vasu from a theatre and asks him what he knows. Vasu tells him that indeed Bala was a leak and he was helping him along with a person named Reed from Singapore. Vikram calls Jaya and requests her to use her sources. She agrees to help and later consoles Vikram about his wife.\r\n\r\nAs told by Jaya, Vikram reaches Bangkok where a source of Jaya (Dibang) tells him that he has a tape. Vikram is shocked to see that Bala was honeytrapped, forcing him to divulge all the information about their movements. Bala later commits suicide by shooting himself. Back in Delhi, R&AW had decoded the intercepts and had also found out about Bala's fake passports and unknown bank accounts. RD realises that this might be a Code Red, to assassinate the ex Prime Minister. He asks Vikram to take care of this and tells his team to seal the coastline. A massive manhunt begins and hundreds of LTF associates are nabbed by Indian security forces and local cops. In the Madras R&AW office, Arjun, an officer tracks down the conversation of Vijayan Joseph, a bombmaker and Anna and tells this to Rishi (Tarun Bali). Rishi tells this to Vikram and further says that Kannan Kanan, an associate of Anna's man Kanda, is in Madurai Jail and might be helpful. Kannan reveals that some suspicious refugees came from the island to Tamil Nadu. After a short but important meeting with Jaya, Vikram sees X on a clock at the Airport and deduces that the LTF is going to assassinate the ex PM on the same day at X PM (10 PM). RD then calls the ex PM to cancel his rally, but he replies that he'll be alright. Vikram then manages to catch Vijayan from his hideout who tells that the refugees are going to assassinate the ex PM by plastic explosives which are untraceable to metal detectors.\r\n\r\nVikram rushes to the place where the ex PM is taking part in the rally. He reaches there nearly on time, but the suicide bomber manages to put the wreath on the neck of the ex PM and while bowing down, she pulls the trigger and kills him along with herself and many others. Vikram manages to recover but sits there dejected and defeated. Later, Vikram submits his report on the assassination to the investigation committee who considers his report. A few days later, RD too resigns, and Vikram, after taking a voluntary retirement, comes in Kasauli.\r\n\r\nThe movie comes to present where the priest asks Vikram who won the battle. Vikram says he doesn't know, but in this battle, Indians lost their Prime Minister and Lankan Tamils lost their future. He later walks away, reciting the lines of \"Where the mind is without fear\". He completes another report and sends it to Jaya in Singapore who starts her work on that report. In Kasauli, Vikram moves out of the house he was living in.\r\n\r\nAn epilogue tells that the civil war continued for 27 years, killing more than 40 thousand Sri Lankan subjects, 30 thousand Tamil rebels, 21 Sri Lankan forces and 1200 Indian forces, and still thousands of Lankan Tamils are homeless. In 2009, Sri Lankan forces launched a brutal aerial and land attack, finishing the rebels along with their leader.","TrailerLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnkKI01I0Ac","TrailerEmbedCode":"<iframe width=\"850\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hnkKI01I0Ac\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Action","RatingCount":16,"Rating":3.9,"CensorRating":"U/A","ReleaseDate":"8/23/2013","Runtime":130,"Budget":350000000,"Revenue":510000000,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/80D6B84F353148C634520116550680E7.jpg"},{"Id":"c3eb8351","ImdbId":"tt3037260","OriginalTitle":"The Good Road","Title":"The Good Road","Description":"The Good Road is a 2013 Indian drama film written and directed by Gyan Correa.

He meets Aarohi (Shraddha Kapoor), a bar singer who idolizes Rahul. After noticing Aarohi looking at a photograph of Lata Mangeshkar in the bar, he assumes that she wants to become a singer. Impressed by her simplicity and voice, Rahul promises to transform her into a singing sensation, and asks her to never perform again in bars. Aarohi leaves her job and returns to Mumbai with Rahul, who convinces record producer Saigal (Mahesh Thakur) to meet her. When Aarohi calls Rahul, he is attacked and injured by some thugs, and is unable to receive her call. His friend and manager Vivek (Shaad Randhaawa) says that news of Rahul's accident should not be leaked to the media, and instead publicises a false story that Rahul has left the country to participate in stage shows. When Aarohi attempts to contact Rahul again, Vivek ignores the calls. After two months of fruitlessly attempting to contact Rahul, a broken Aarohi is forced to sing in bars again because of her family problems.\r\n\r\nAfter recovering from his injuries, Rahul vows to search for Aarohi.

Twelve years later he is still a charismatic, suave womaniser, who has extended his empire to the Mideast. Khan's only friends are Javed (Sarfaraz Khan) (who oversees his illegal work), his former love Mumtaz (Sonali Bendre), and Aslam (Imran Khan), a teenager Khan met during a visit to the slums in which he grew up.\r\n\r\nAn older Khan returns to Bombay to kill Rawal (Mahesh Manjrekar), who opposed his ambition to take the reins in Bombay. Although the city was his first love, rising starlet Jasmine (Sonakshi Sinha) wins his heart. Khan advances Jasmine's career by rigging awards, and showers her with gifts; he becomes obsessed with her. He sends Aslam and another trustworthy aide, Jimmy, to kill Rawal. Jimmy fails, accidentally killing his girlfriend, Sonia, and flees. He is soon captured by the police, hot on Khan's trail after learning about his arrival in Bombay. Jimmy, loyal to Khan, does not crack during his interrogation and is freed due to lack of evidence. The police intend to draw Khan out from hiding; he has eluded them for twelve years, and this is their last chance to take him on Indian soil.\r\n\r\nKhan, suspicious that Jimmy has become a police informer, decides to kill him but Aslam offers to do the deed to deflect police attention. He, Dedh Tang and several thugs masquerade as rival biker gangs and stage a brawl. Plainclothes police officers try to control the chaos when Aslam corners Jimmy. When a police officer stops Aslam, Khan appears out of nowhere, murders Jimmy and injures the policeman. A chase ensues; the police fail to catch the two, who escape in Khan's Mercedes.\r\n\r\nAlthough Khan has bought Jasmine a house, she rejects his advances, saying that she has never seen him as being more than a friend. Angry and disappointed, Khan slaps her and tells her to leave. He angrily destroys the set of the film she is cast in, leaving with her a twenty-four hour deadline to accept his proposal. Jasmine returns home to see that Khan has filled her house with expensive presents. Her mother is taken aback when Jasmine explains that Khan is a gangster with whom she'd prefer not to associate. Her family questions the sense in rejecting a man as powerful and dangerous as Khan.\r\n\r\nLater in the night, Jasmine meets Aslam at his uncle's restaurant. He tries to explain his love for her, only to be interrupted and told that she is engaged and the two should stop seeing one another. Dejected and disappointed, Aslam meets with Khan, who seems unusually pensive. The two lament their relationships, not knowing they are both in love with the same woman. Just before Aslam is about to reveal the name of his romantic interest, a phone rings - Khan, jubilant, announces that his proposal has been accepted and orders Aslam to pick up his new \"bhabhi,\" or sister-in-law.\r\n\r\nAslam arrives at the address Khan has given him and, much to his shock, sees Jasmine walking towards his car. Initially angry that he is still following her, the two realize that they have been caught up in a complicated affair - that Aslam, unbeknownst to Jasmine, works for Khan, and that Jasmine was the one he had been sent to pick up. Before either can speak, a car containing Rawal and his henchmen arrives at a distance. Rawal shoots Jasmine, having learned of her relationship with Khan and hoping that hurting her lure the gangster into a vulnerable position.\r\n\r\nJasmine remains unconscious at the hospital as Khan arrives. He accuses Aslam of being in love with his fiancÃ©e - an accusation which Aslam denies as Khan reveals that he has masterminded a plan to murder Rawal and ensure his own dominance over the Mumbai underworld. Khan intends to fabricate a story of him feuding with Aslam to tempt Rawal and his rivals into contacting Aslam. The \"news\" reaches Rawal, who seems delighted at the prospect of being able to turn Khan's right-hand man against him.\r\n\r\nWhen Rawal calls Aslam at the hospital, Aslam, now fully aware of Khan's feelings towards Jasmine, seems unsure whether to abide by Khan's plan. He reluctantly provides Rawal with an address, ending the phone call by telling him to \"murder the bastard.\" Khan, lying in wait outside the address with a sniper rifle, kills Rawal and his henchmen when they arrive. Khan, having consolidated power, savours his victory and walks into a police station as a taunt to law enforcement. However, Dedh Tang accidentally reveals Aslam's love for Jasmine in the midst of celebration. Khan, infuriated, diverts the car to the hospital to confront Aslam, who has continued to stay with Jasmine as she recovers from being shot by Rawal. Knowing that his friend is in danger, Dedh Tang honks the horn of the car repeatedly after Shoaib and his henchmen enter the building, alerting Aslam to the danger and giving him time to escape. Entering to see an empty bed where Jasmine had before been laying, Khan realizes that Dedh Tang had given him away.\r\n\r\nKhan sends his aide Akbar to kill Aslam after he and Jasmine flee to Aslam's uncle's restaurant in Dongri. Aslam assures Jasmine that Khan, though violent, would never hurt him. Their conversation is interrupted by a car's horn honking - running outside, Aslam is ambushed by Akbar after discovering the body of Dedh Tang, who has been killed by Shoaib for aiding the couple in their escape. Aslam, though injured and initially losing the fight, kills Akbar with a shovel. He calls Khan to tell him that the murder of Dedh Tang has, in effect, erased his deep-seated loyalty to his former boss. Khan responds by telling Aslam that sending Akbar was a mistake, as he must be the one to kill the man he views as also having betrayed him by \"stealing\" Jasmine.\r\n\r\nAslam and Khan confront one another as the police, having been alerted to Khan's location by a storekeeper, descend upon Dongri. Shoaib rains down blows and insults upon Aslam, urging him to defend himself in front of Jasmine. Nevertheless, Aslam, who still feels indebted and bound to Khan, does not fight back until Inspector Awant appears through the gathered crowd - even then, Aslam only pushes Khan away so that Khan is not shot by the officer. Reacting quickly, Khan draws a pistol of his own and shoots Awant before turning his weapon on Jasmine and Aslam. Jasmine, through tears and while holding a bleeding Aslam, tells Khan that he is truly evil and will never have her love. Khan seems to recognize the truth in her words as he drops his weapon and stares at the couple. Just then, more police officers arrive on the scene and open fire on Khan, who, now injured, is dragged away by one of his henchmen. He and Aslam, both alive but bloodied, lock eyes and reach out for another, having finally put aside their differences.\r\n\r\nIn the last scene, a bullet-ridden, dejected Khan reads a letter he was unable to give Jasmine in the cargo hold of a ship.","TrailerLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dj9UXzyDsOA","TrailerEmbedCode":"<iframe width=\"850\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dj9UXzyDsOA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Action","RatingCount":10,"Rating":2.45,"CensorRating":"U/A","ReleaseDate":"8/14/2013","Runtime":160,"Budget":0,"Revenue":1000000000,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/1EF3918902EF54BD591647B988155451.jpg"},{"Id":"aacc0b45","ImdbId":"tt2361022","OriginalTitle":"Deewana Main Deewana","Title":"Deewana Main Deewana","Description":"","TrailerLink":"","TrailerEmbedCode":"","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"","RatingCount":1,"Rating":2.0,"CensorRating":"","ReleaseDate":"2/1/2013","Runtime":0,"Budget":0,"Revenue":0,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/3354EEA60A914949F4D1347D4E4DD591.jpg"},{"Id":"dca18359","ImdbId":"tt2614032","OriginalTitle":"Alex Pandian","Title":"Alex Pandian","Description":"","TrailerLink":"","TrailerEmbedCode":"","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"","RatingCount":1,"Rating":2.0,"CensorRating":"","ReleaseDate":"1/12/2013","Runtime":135,"Budget":0,"Revenue":0,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/59E739B3033987E10A0B5CDBCADDF62E.jpg"},{"Id":"423d98de","ImdbId":"tt2375567","OriginalTitle":"Super Model","Title":"Super Model","Description":"Super Model is a 2013 Hindi thriller featuring Veena Malik and Ashmit Patel in the lead roles.

He speaks to SI Ranveer Singh (Jimmy Shergill) who agrees to send the required number of support officers. Ajay, with accomplices P.K.

They then move to different parts of the country where they're from and merge into their everyday lifestyles. Ajay's love interest, Priya (Kajal Aggarwal), an about-to-be-married teacher, is introduced here. The crew meets again in Chandigarh at the behest of Sharma for his daughter's wedding.\r\n\r\nRanveer with his senior officer meet the minister of the earlier raid, who reveals that he doesn't want the news to appear in the public domain because he wants to protect his image.

Following the more difficult but successful raid, Khan insists that this should be reported in the newspaper, despite nobody coming forward to report it themselves, as black money is involved. Upon seeing this in the newspaper, Ajay and Sharma decide to conduct their \"big job,\" a final raid in Mumbai.\r\n\r\nAfter the second income tax raid, the story briefly focuses on Ajay and Priya, with the latter's marriage being planned.

When Sharma is talking to Ajay on the phone, Khan procures several details about them, including the names Joginder and Iqbal and 'Ajju' (Ajay's nickname). As a result, under Khan's orders, officers track the crew to Mumbai to a hotel where they're staying.

It is stated that, on the day, the candidates will be trained and then led out for the mock raid in the afternoon. However, no details about the raid have come to light.\r\n\r\nTo find out more, Khan and Ranveer go to the hotel and force their way into Sharma's room. He divulges the information about the raid, following a threat of violence. He also mentions that Ajay is taking revenge on the CBI for not appointing him. Khan orders Sharma to ensure everything proceeds as normal.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the raid, Khan takes charge of the jewellery store, and replaces the goods with fake jewellery, with the originals being moved to a nearby workshop. He is given constant information about the activity of the crew and recruits. Ajay informs the recruits that he will come in a different vehicle to them. Sharma leaves with the recruits in a bus, but leaves the bus at police headquarters, saying that he will arrive with Ajay. He also states that nobody should leave the bus until they arrive and that he is going to verify the paperwork for the raid. In reality, he goes to meet Ranveer Singh.

Ajay then goes and meets Priya at the airport.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at the jewellery store, Khan is informed that the raid was conducted at the workshop and all jewellery in the workshop along with the jewellery that were moved were stolen. Khan works it all out for himself, realising that Ranveer was part of the gang and he wasn't a real police officer, and they were set up right from the beginning. Khan starts laughing loudly and applauding the entire robbery. Later, Khan receives a money order for Rs. 100 that Ajay had taken from him with the message that he could not steal the honest earnings of an officer. The film ends with Khan being told over the phone that the CBI has information about the perpetrators. At the same time we see Ajay Singh and P.K.

Since his childhood, Kundan has had a strong and obsessive one-sided love for Zoya Haider (Sonam Kapoor), a Muslim girl residing in the same neighborhood. He always attempts to be around her but gets slapped several times in the process. Zoya finally changes her mind because of Kundan's consistency of affection. Her family is orthodox, preventing the lovers from being together. After Zoya moves to Aligarh for further studies, Kundan harmonizes with Zoya's family, assisting them with chores. Zoya gets into Jawaharlal Nehru University and discovers a long-lost strength as she confronts and then falls for student leader Akram Zaidi (Abhay Deol).\r\n\r\nAfter eight years, Zoya returns to Varanasi, barely recognizing Kundan when she meets him again. Kundan again attempts to ask Zoya for her love but she is reluctant, revealing that she is in love with Akram. She urges Kundan to convince her family about her marriage with Akram. Kundan eventually agrees and gets their wedding arranged, promising Zoya that he will also marry someone else and forget her. He proposes to his childhood friend Bindiya (Swara Bhaskar), who has had a crush on him since childhood.\r\n\r\nOn the day of Zoya's marriage, Kundan finds out that Akram is a Sikh, whose actual name is Jasjeet Singh Shergill. This enrages him, as Zoya had used their religious differences to convince him that their match was not possible. He crashes the wedding ceremony and reveals the truth to Zoya's parents. Kundan is later informed that Zoya tried to commit suicide, and Jasjeet was mercilessly beaten by Zoya's relatives. At the hospital, Jasjeet tells Kundan that Zoya convinced him to portray himself as Muslim to marry her, a plan he should not have agreed to. While with Jasjeet, Kundan forgets about his own marriage ceremony with Bindiya, taking place that day, and is too late when he returns. Hurt and angry, Kundan's family disowns him. Jasjeet's parents take him back to his village. Kundan tries to redeem himself by taking Zoya to Jasjeet's village. There, he is devastated to find that Jasjeet has succumbed to his injuries, finally understanding that his one-sided love has resulted in an innocent man's death.\r\n\r\nKundan becomes a homeless vagrant and begins visiting various religious places and volunteering in their activities so that he can atone for his sins. During one such visit, a man advises him to do the right thing rather than run away from his sins. Motivated, Kundan locates Zoya to her university, where she is spearheading the political party \"All India Citizen Party\" (AICP), that had been created by Jasjeet. Kundan joins the nearby canteen and serves the party, while trying to get Zoya's attention. Over time, he becomes popular with the party due to his simple nature. They're also impressed when Kundan helps them in negotiating some tough situations by using his simplistic witty tricks. However, Zoya holds a grudge that the person who is responsible for Jasjeet's death is now taking his place. She tries to instigate party members against Kundan but Jasjeet's sister Rashmi (Shilpi Marwaha) tells Kundan to continue, as he is the best choice for fulfilling Jasjeet's vision.\r\n\r\nKundan, however, only wants Zoya to forgive him. The Chief Minister tells Zoya that she must get revenge on Kundan. To get back Jasjeet's position, she tells Zoya to let Kundan get injured as he delivers his campaign speech. Zoya apparently seems to get brainwashed by this plan and as the Chief Minister desired, Kundan is hurt badly and sent to ICU, thus fulfilling Zoya's revenge.\r\n\r\nAt a press meet, the Chief Minister denies having any hand in the blast that hurt Kundan. However, Zoya steps forward and reveals that the plan was plotted by her and the Chief Minister and that she is prepared to go to prison for this. Zoya then finds out that Kundan was aware of the plot and still let himself be injured. Shocked, she rushes to the hospital to be with him.\r\n\r\nIn a final voiceover, a dying Kundan wonders about letting go. He says he might have the desire to live again if Zoya called out to him, but then again, everything has become so tiring, he would rather let go and rest (euphemism for dying). He says that he can be born again and again in the same Varanasi, fall in love with a girl like Zoya again, and become a Raanjhanaa in her love. Then he slowly dies.","TrailerLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ER9vmhxFucg","TrailerEmbedCode":"<iframe width=\"850\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ER9vmhxFucg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Drama","RatingCount":16,"Rating":3.8,"CensorRating":"U/A","ReleaseDate":"6/21/2013","Runtime":140,"Budget":350000000,"Revenue":1200000000,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/954E13B868C9E6ACE5957DBF356F3A89.jpg"},{"Id":"a6a0e3d4","ImdbId":"tt2246724","OriginalTitle":"Ghanchakkar","Title":"Ghanchakkar","Description":"Sanjay (Emraan Hashmi) is a master safe cracker who maintains a casual lifestyle with his wife Neetu (Vidya Balan).

Bobo and Misha are shown to live with their Dad in the family apartment with their mother having died some time earlier. Bobo is seen reading a book of Witchcraft from which he discovers the number 666 and uses it to travel on the apartment elevator to some unlisted floor at the bottom of the building, which he confides to Misha as being the entry to hell. According to Bobo, each building has its own hell, where the \"bad people\" of the building are consigned for eternity once they are dead. Soon after Bobo and Misha's trip on the elevator, a woman named Diana (Konkona Sen Sharma) moves into the building. Bobo is convinced that she is a witch and that she has surfaced from down under following his and Misha's trip on the elevator.\r\n\r\nDiana immediately charms Bobo's single father and agrees to babysit the kids. She soon becomes a part of the family by marrying Bobo's father, although the paranoid Bobo still believes she's a witch. Meanwhile, Bobo learns from the book that the source of a Daayan's power is her plait, while that of a Pishacha is his neck. On Diana's birthday during the night of the red moon she convinces the kids to a game of hide and seek in an attempt to sacrifice Misha in order to restore her dark powers. As she begins to look for the kids, Bobo peeks through his hideout to see what she's doing. Bobo's father returns claiming to have forgotten his files and goes to look for them while Bobo goes to check on his sister. Finding the door locked Bobo begins to panic which brings his father to the door. Bobo's father knocks down the door only to find Misha lifeless in the trunk and a now undisguised Diana hovering over her body. Enraged, Bobo's father attempts to choke Diana but in vain as the now rejuvenated Diana kills him with her ear-piercing screams. Diana moves to the window to perform the rest of her ritual. But the distraught Bobo finds his father's dagger and cuts off Diana's plait, destroying her source of power. A shocked Diana begins to crumble into dust but not before she reveals that everything she did, she did for him and promises to return for Bobo.\r\n\r\nDr. Palit (Rajatava Dutta) dismisses Bobo's visions as just fantasy and convinces Bobo to do the same. After a brief outburst at the restaurant Bobo is knocked unconscious and taken to the hospital, where Tamara learns about his hallucinations. He then asks Tamara to marry him and they adopt the ten-year-old Zubin.\r\n\r\nEverything goes well till the irresistible Lisa Dutt (Kalki Koechlin) enters their life during a magic show. Bobo suspects that the Daayan is back, but nobody believes him. In fact everybody loves Lisa. She even buys his old house, adding to his suspicion. Even Bobo starts thinking that it is all his imagination and that he is losing his mind.\r\n\r\nBut his suspicion turns to belief when during Lisa's house warming party, Tamara falls off the balcony. A critical Tamara is taken to the hospital. A few days later Lisa comes to visit Tamara. As she tries to unhook Tamara's IV bag, Bobo walks in and questions her in a fury. She claims that all she was trying to do is unhook the IV bag as it's empty. But the now aggressive Bobo tells her to get out. Afraid for his family, he calls Dr. Palit and who agrees to help investigate further.\r\n\r\nDr. Palit finds a very disturbing truth and calls Bobo telling him that he was right all along. But in the meantime, the Daayan appears as Diana in Dr. Palit's clinic and kills him. As Bobo reaches Dr. Palit's clinic he finds Dr. Palit dead and sees the eerie lizard lurking about. He finds a paper clutched in Dr. Palit's hand, on which Zubin's name is scribbled. He rushes to the exhibition where Zubin is supposed to be, only to find him missing. He then rushes back to his old home too look for Zubin but finds it empty as well. So he jumps into the elevator and descends into hell.\r\n\r\nThere, he finds Zubin lying on a sacrificial altar and the Daayan ready to sacrifice his son's life to sustain her powers. Bobo tries to save Zubin, when he encounters Tamara. To his surprise, Tamara is the Daayan, not Lisa. Then, Diana appears and tells him that he himself is a Pishacha. Tamara explains further by saying that no one could merely push buttons in an elevator and find hell. The fact that he is present with them, is the evidence of him being a Pishacha. He tries to fight her, but she is enraged and tells Bobo that it took her 20 years to be reborn and she won't let him kill her again. She knocks Bobo unconscious.\r\n\r\nWhen he regains consciousness, he recalls the book about black magic and realizes that a Pishacha, good or bad can regain his strength as it is the night of the red moon. With his acquired powers, he fights Tamara and supposedly kills her. Soon after that, he returns his powers back to Satan. As he picks up Zubin, the Daayan now appearing as Diana reveals that only the pure and innocent can kill a Daayan and since Bobo killed her once before as a kid he is no longer innocent. Angry that Bobo denied Satan's gift Diana attacks him with her hair since it is the origin of her strength. Diana wraps her hair tightly around Bobo's neck to destroy his life force. Powerless, he tries to fight with her only to be flung around. Bobo grabs on to a pillar and an amused Diana once again immobilizes him with her high-pitched screeches but Bobo kicks the sacrificial dagger to the now conscious Zubin, and Bobo twists Diana and wraps her own hair on her mouth to stop the sound reaching Zubin's ears. Zubin eventually cuts off Diana's plait, but the crumbling Diana once again promises that she will come back.\r\n\r\nIn the end Zubin asks him whether everything that happened was magic or witchcraft. Bobo tells him that everyone has a little of both good and bad, but they themselves have to choose which side they're on. Bobo meets Lisa at the cafe and she asks him why he was so aggressive towards her initially. The screen fades to black as Bobo says, \"I thought you were a Daayan\".","TrailerLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN5Ss-EV_qc","TrailerEmbedCode":"<iframe width=\"850\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UN5Ss-EV_qc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Horror","RatingCount":12,"Rating":2.8,"CensorRating":"U/A","ReleaseDate":"4/19/2013","Runtime":0,"Budget":240000000,"Revenue":450000000,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/1F6A5FAB035C4A45B82F79B6DF746BB9.jpg"},{"Id":"659a6bbd","ImdbId":"tt2341766","OriginalTitle":"Nautanki Saala","Title":"Nautanki Saala","Description":"The story is about the friendship and the bonding between RP and Mandar and how they face problems and solve them.\r\n\r\nRam Parmar a.k.a.

He loses control and crashes into a wall on the footpath by the road. The film cuts to a court scene where Jagdish Tyagi aka Jolly (Arshad Warsi), an LLB (law-degree) graduate defending a surgeon against a Public interest litigation (PIL) filed against him after the surgeon had his son operate upon a patient in his pursuit of Guinness Book of World Records. Jolly loses the case but decides to move to the capital Delhi to try his luck. He happens to see prominent criminal lawyer Tejinder Rajpal (Boman Irani) defending Rahul Dewan in a sessions court. Rahul Dewan is accused of causing death under the influence of alcohol. Rajpal convinces the judge that prosecution had no evidence to implicate Rahul Dewan and he was being deliberately targeted by the media as he was from a rich family, resulting in Dewan's acquittal.\r\n\r\nRajpal, though, is not satisfied with the fee paid by the Dewans. Jolly, desperate to have some money and fame, decides to pursue the case and files a PIL in the court against Rahul Dewan's acquittal. After initially reprimanding Jolly for his mistakes in filing the PIL and taking the press reports as an evidence, Justice Tripathi (Saurabh Shukla) gives a date for hearing and warns Jolly to collect some evidence before the hearing. He then runs into Albert Pinto (Harsh Chhaya), who claims to have witnessed the accident. Then Jolly introduces him as a witness in the court and Judge Tripathi, after cross-examining him, gives a date for the next hearing. He also summons Rahul Dewan to be present in the court for the hearing. Jolly becomes a celebrity overnight and is admired by Kaul who donates a room in his restaurant to Jolly for using it as his office. However, Jolly's plans turn upside down, when Albert Pinto reveals to him that he is no witness, but a crony of Rajpal and it was part of a plan to extract more money from Dewan clan. As part of the deal, Pinto gives Jolly his share of the money paid by Dewans to silence Pinto. Jolly gleefully accepts the money and regrets that had he known this plan earlier, he would have demanded more money.

Judge Tripathi orders the Police to provide a bodyguard for Jolly after he was manhandled by alleged assistants of Rajpal. Jolly comes to know that a survivor of the accident stays in Gorakhpur and decides to leave for Gorakhpur. SI Rathi tries to sabotage Jolly's investigation, but is rescued by his bodyguard. He identifies one Sadakanth Mishra as the survivor in Gorakhpur and brings him to Delhi. Jolly prosecutes SI Rathi and finds that he has botched up the investigation by declaring Sadakanth Mishra as dead and snatching his hard-earned money to stop him from killing Mishra. Mishra also identifies Rahul Dewan as the one who drove the Land Cruiser. After conclusion of arguments and counter-arguments between Rajpal and Jolly, Judge Tripathi directs Delhi Police to suspend SI Rathi and initiate a criminal inquiry against him and also declares Rahul Dewan as guilty of the crime and sentences him to seven years in jail under Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code.

Teja manages to get Vijay at gun point and pulls his coat's sleeve back. Then Vijay notices a tattoo on Teja's arm and realizes that he is the very one who killed his parents. Then Vijay says that Prashant Khanna who Teja killed years back was Vijay's dad. Teja is shocked and reveals that Prashant had filed a case against him and so Teja had to kill Prashant. In a fit of rage, Vijay begins to beat Teja badly. Vijay then breaks Teja's arm and kicks him into a bundle of petroleum barrels and shoots the barrels, causing Teja to die in the blast.

The next day, he publicly humiliates Sher Singh's daughter, Rekha because she was beating up her innocent driver. In response, Rekha (Tamannaah Bhatia) unleashes a tiger on the village in front of Ravi. Her plan was unsuccessful, however, as it backfired. Rekha falls down from the terrace and is about to be attacked by the animal, when Ravi jumps and saves her life. Rekha falls in love with Ravi, and afterwards, saves Ravi's life against his father's plans.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Ravi comes to know that Padma is in love with Shakti, Narayan Das's son. He has his objections and so has Narayan. However, Sher Singh tells Narayan Das that marrying Shakti with Padma would give them an upper hand over Ravi as they can ill-treat Padma and keep Ravi in control. Meanwhile, Padma now knows that Ravi is not her real brother, and the real Ravi died in a road accident. Before dying, the real Ravi asked him to take care of his family. Padma is initially upset, but then reconciles after Ravi saves her life.\r\n\r\nShortly after Padma and Shakti get married, both the father and son start ill-treating Padma. In revenge, Ravi uses Rekha against her own father, just like what she advises him. After Rekha tells her father that she is pregnant with Ravi, Sher Singh begs Ravi to marry his daughter. Eventually, Ravi punished Narayan Das and Shakti by doing all the household chores. He also wins the Sarpanch election, and Sher Singh finally gives all the property documents back to the villagers, which Sher Singh had illegally taken from them before.\r\n\r\nHowever, Shakti overhears Rekha and Ravi's conversation about the fake pregnancy and that he is not the real Ravi. Angered, Sher Singh tries to kill him by bringing 20 fighters from the city, but failed. While they are beating Ravi, the tiger (which Ravi had fought with) comes and saves his life. Ravi then brutally beats Shakti, and is about to kill Sher Singh when his mother stops him.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Sher Singh, Narayan Das and Shakti ask for the forgiveness from Ravi, Savitri and the rest of the villagers.","TrailerLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neqBc-8f4tY","TrailerEmbedCode":"<iframe width=\"850\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/neqBc-8f4tY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Action","RatingCount":4,"Rating":0.9,"CensorRating":"U/A","ReleaseDate":"3/29/2013","Runtime":150,"Budget":680000000,"Revenue":583400000,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/BA9259055A941EE4EB38B27781E66C42.jpg"},{"Id":"4b441c4c","ImdbId":"tt2198235","OriginalTitle":"Monsoon Shootout","Title":"Monsoon Shootout","Description":"","TrailerLink":"","TrailerEmbedCode":"","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"","RatingCount":1,"Rating":2.0,"CensorRating":"","ReleaseDate":"5/31/2013","Runtime":82,"Budget":0,"Revenue":0,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/C14D1CE2C22437AD54BD9BD76A47086E.jpg"},{"Id":"d6f7a6b7","ImdbId":"tt2389974","OriginalTitle":"Aatma","Title":"Aatma","Description":"","TrailerLink":"","TrailerEmbedCode":"","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"","RatingCount":3,"Rating":1.5,"CensorRating":"","ReleaseDate":"3/21/2013","Runtime":100,"Budget":0,"Revenue":0,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/3D514EC20052721E29E32A6B516BBD75.jpg"},{"Id":"5be3e755","ImdbId":"tt2215477","OriginalTitle":"Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela","Title":"Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela","Description":"In the fictional Gujarati village of Ranjaar, which is infamous for its uninhibited manufacture and sale of arms and ammunition, two clans, Rajadi and Sanera, have been at odds with each other for the past 500 years. The film opens with a violent altercation between the two over petty matters. Meghji (Abhimanyu Singh), a Rajadi head, sets out to kill Bhavani (Gulshan Devaiah), who is a Sanera, after the latter tries to kill the former's son. Bhavani is almost killed but Meghji's younger brother Ram (Ranveer Singh) intervenes and saves him, only to be reprimanded by his clan. The Rajadi heads are irked by Ram's mindset of making truce with the other clan and living without violence.\r\n\r\nDuring the festival of Holi, Ram boldly enters the house of the Sanera heads and flirts with Leela (Deepika Padukone), while her mother, Dhankor Baa (Supriya Pathak Kapur), the chieftain of the Saneras, is busy arranging a match for her daughter with a simple-minded NRI. Leela's elder brother Kanji (Sharad Kelkar) is angered by Ram's entry in the house and bribes the local police to raid Ram's house. Ram, however, manages to convince the policemen to leave in exchange for a set of his blue films. Ram and Leela develop a romance and plan to elope but a grim turn of events follows when Kanji accidentally kills Meghji, and is in turn killed by Ram.\r\n\r\nTo escape the suffering, Ram and Leela elope and marry but just as they are about to consummate their marriage, Ram's friends trace them and betray him by inebriating him and informing Leela's family of their location. The next morning, Leela is forcibly taken back home by Bhavani, her cousin, while Ram is hailed as a hero by the Rajadis for soiling Leela's reputation. He is rewarded by being made the new chieftain of the Rajadi. Meanwhile, Dhankor Baa (Supriya Pathak) arranges the engagement of Leela and the NRI, much to the chagrin of the pair. Leela refuses, citing that her finger is already occupied by the ring from her marriage to Ram. In her anger, Dhankor Baa chops off Leela's finger and upon learning of this, Ram does the same to his own finger and visits Leela while she is asleep. Leela still retains faith in Ram and sends Rasila (Richa Chadda), the widow of Kanji, to give Ram an ultimatum to take her away. Rasila is assaulted by Ram's friends and when Dhankor Baa learns of this, she sends Bhavani and other men to assault Kesar (Barkha Bisht Sengupta), Meghji's widow, who manages to evade them.\r\n\r\nIn response to the attempt on Kesar, Ram storms into Leela's house and incapacitates the guards single-handedly. He then requests Dhankor Baa to consider negotiation for peace, and she invites him to celebrate Navratri with the Saneras, with the intention to kill him. However, at the event, Bhavani secretly shoots and seriously injures Dhankor Baa to place the blame on the Rajadi. Leela is made the chieftain of the Sanera and gets busy tending to her mother. She bitterly carries out a negotiation with Ram, equally dividing the travel routes and trades, with the condition that the Sanera and Rajadi will not interact ever again. Bhavani does not tolerate this development and deceives Leela, having her blindly sign a document that orders unrestrained killings of the Rajadi. During Dusshera, as the Ramlila parade is ending, many of the Rajadi are killed and the village is on the brink of war, which Ram senses. Ram and Leela believe they are the sole owners of each other's lives and they both decide to commit suicide instead of die fighting. They both shoot each other with a smile on each faces, and die. Oblivious that Dhankor Baa has undergone a change of heart and has killed Bhavani, ordering peace be meted out to the other clan. The two clans finally unite to cremate the bodies of Ram and Leela together respectfully.","TrailerLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StphRCLkx6Q","TrailerEmbedCode":"<iframe width=\"850\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/StphRCLkx6Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Action","RatingCount":13,"Rating":3.15,"CensorRating":"U/A","ReleaseDate":"11/15/2013","Runtime":150,"Budget":850000000,"Revenue":2020000000,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/52801CAD19FFCDFCCAEC13AA94D771BD.jpg"},{"Id":"45337d64","ImdbId":"tt2224317","OriginalTitle":"Lootera","Title":"Lootera","Description":"After Pakhi has an asthma attack from the ensuing excitement, she is rushed home and given medication. As she recuperates, her father comforts her and narrates the story of the invincible king whose soul resided inside a parrot, telling her that she is the parrot within whom his life resides.\r\n\r\nOne day, while learning to drive a car, Pakhi accidentally bumps into a motorcycle and mildly injures a handsome youth. A few days later, the same youth introduces himself to the landlord as Varun Shrivastav (Ranveer Singh), an archaeologist who wants to study the land surrounding the temple that the landlord owns. Over the next few weeks, Varun charms the landlord and his daughter with his knowledge and persona, and is invited, along with his assistant, to live at their home.\r\n\r\nSoon, love brews between Varun and Pakhi as they bond over art and literature, and their love culminates into a passionate affair. Meanwhile, an act passed by the Indian government debars the power of landlords, causing tension in the Chaudhary household. The ancient artefacts the family owns must be sold, and Varun helps arrange the purchases.\r\n\r\nAs Varun's stay comes to an end, he asks Pakhi's father for her hand in marriage, and preparations of their wedding begin. Before the wedding, Varun's uncle, who has raised him, arrives and discourages Varun from marriage, stating that Varun will only give Pakhi grief because of the danger of what he does for a livingâ€”people like them are not meant to fall in love and have normal lives. Varun is conflicted but agrees and makes his choice: he and his assistant flee that very night, along with all the valuables they stole from the landlord. On the wedding day, Varun is nowhere to be found, and it is discovered that the idols from the temple have been stolen and the currency notes from the purchase that Varun arranged of the family's artifacts are all counterfeit.\r\n\r\nA year later, a sick Pakhi is living all alone in Dalhousie. Her father has died and she has still not recovered from her heartbreak. When a police inspector asks her in helping him nab Varun, she refuses to do so, wanting only to forget him. Soon after, Varun and his friend turn up at Dalhousie for their next heist and stay at a lodge on Pakhi's property. Things turn ugly when the police gets wind of their whereabouts and a chase ensues. After Varun accidentally kills his friend along with a constable, he seeks refuge in Pakhi's house.\r\n\r\nAlthough Pakhi does not turn him over to the police, she is nevertheless enraged and repels Varun's comforting advances and explanation. In a letter, she explains to him that she is dying of tuberculosis and will die the day the last leaf falls from the wilting tree outside the window.\r\n\r\nVarun plans his escape but refuses to go, and takes care of the ailing Pakhi instead. He confesses that he has regretted letting her go since the day he fled. Soon, Pakhi warms up to him and her faith remains intact when each day she finds one last leaf remaining on the tree.\r\n\r\nEventually, it is revealed that apart from taking care of Pakhi, Varun would also paint a leaf and tie it on a branch of the tree everyday so that she doesn't give up hope, it was his masterpiece. In the end, as he is about to escape, Varun is shot down by the police while Pakhi realises the truth after she looks at the painted leaf closely, and smiles with tears in her eyes.","TrailerLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaNoRbUabzg","TrailerEmbedCode":"<iframe width=\"850\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KaNoRbUabzg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Drama","RatingCount":15,"Rating":3.7,"CensorRating":"U/A","ReleaseDate":"7/5/2013","Runtime":135,"Budget":270000000,"Revenue":280000000,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/775765417F90529AAA08C8264205C947.jpg"},{"Id":"900cfc3b","ImdbId":"tt2804026","OriginalTitle":"Aurangzeb","Title":"Aurangzeb","Description":"ACP Arya, a police officer, has been brought up by his uncle, DCP Ravikant Phogat (Rishi Kapoor). His father, police inspector Vijaykant Phogat (Anupam Kher), had lost interest in life years back, after messing up an operation to kill Yashvardhan Singh (Jackie Shroff), due to lack of evidence against him. Yashvardhanâ€™s wife, Veera (Tanvi Azmi), had become a police informer against her own husband and had to run away from him with one of her twin children Vishal (Arjun Kapoor) while Ajay is left with Yashvardhan. Vijaykant hides Vishal and Veera â€“ whom he has begun to love â€“ and passes it off as a botched encounter for which he takes the entire blame. Suspended from the police force, Vijaykant has a tough time over the years, caught between the love for his real family and son ACP Arya, and his adopted wife and son. Years later, just before he dies, he reveals to Arya that he has another wife and kid but doesn't reveal their real identity. Vijaykant dies few days later and Arya goes to meet Veera. There he is shocked to see Vishal, who is the exact replica of Ajay (Arjun Kapoor).\r\n\r\nRavikant, who is corrupt to the core, hatches a plot to expose the criminal activities of Yashvardhan, a mission left incomplete by his brother Vijaykant. He joins forces with nephew Arya and convinces Vishal to enter Yashvardhanâ€™s house, posing as Ajay. To facilitate matters, Ajay is kidnapped by Ravikant and Arya and held captive by them, paving the way for Vishal to take his place and leak information about Yashvardhan's illegal activities to the police. Vishal has to pose as Ajay not just in front of his own father, Yashvardhan, but also in front of Neena Wadhwa (Amrita Singh), Yashvardhan's paramour and business partner. Vishal also has to feign an affair with his twin brotherâ€™s girlfriend, Ritu (Sashaa Agha). As days pass, Vishal falls in love with Ritu. Vishal keeps leaking information about his dad to Ravikant and Arya, who move forward in their exposÃ© with the help of the incriminating evidence. On the other hand, Ravikant and Arya unite Ajay with mother Veera and also try to brainwash him (Ajay) into spilling the beans about his fatherâ€™s illegal businesses before them.\r\n\r\nOver time, Vishal develops a soft corner for his father and pleads for his safety from police. He also wins the confidence of his father, who is unaware that Vishal has replaced Ajay in the house. Calamity befalls Yashvardhan because of action initiated by Ravikant, and he has to be hospitalised. Vishal manipulates things in such a way that Neena has to resign from Yashvardhan Singhâ€™s company. Even as the tension between Arya and foster-brothers Ajay and Vishal refuses to be diffused, the task before Ravikant and Arya becomes very difficult. To make matters more difficult for Ravikant, his son-in-law, Vishnu (Sumeet Vyas), lays his hands on evidence against Ravikantâ€™s equally corrupt police officer-son, ACP Dev (Sikandar Kher). Since Vishnu is the only honest cop in the family, he threatens to expose brother-in-law Dev and in order to prevent this Ravikant kills Vishnu. Ravikant also plans to take over Yashvardhan's empire with help from Neena. Ravikant orders Arya to kill Veera and Ajay. Arya, disillusioned by Ravikant's inhuman attitude, finally understands the choice his father Vijaykant made earlier to protect Vishal and his mother.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Vishal is called for a meeting by Neena and her new partner, Bilal. Ravikant wants Vishal to use the meeting to give him more information about Yashvardhan. Ravikant plans things in such a way that Yashvardhan would be killed once the meeting between Vishal and Neena is over. Arya realises that Ravikant wants to eliminate Yashvardhan not as much to complete brother Vijaykantâ€™s mission as to take over Yashvardhanâ€™s business empire. Also, Vishal has revenge written all over him because Neenaâ€™s son, Inder (Kavi Shastri), had killed Ritu. Here, Ajay finally relents and agrees to help Arya but he also wants his dad, Yashvardhanâ€™s safety. Arya asks Ajay to attend the meeting in place of Vishal. Ajay kills Inder and when Inder's gang tries to kill Ajay, Arya's police team encounters all. Meanwhile Arya has sent Vishal to the Hospital to save Yashvardhan. He also arranges his Police force to raid the Hospital. However Dev sends back the team. He later corners Vishal and Yashvardhan in the Hospital Store Room. Just when Dev was about to kill them, Ajay appears and shoots him. Ajay and Yashvardhan convinces Vishal to escape. Just when Vishal escapes Dev shoots and kills Yashvardhan. In retaliation Ajay kills Dev. When Dev's team was about to kill Ajay, Arya's police force rescues him by arresting Ajay. Arya helps Vishal and Veera escape. Ravikant meets Arya and Arya informs that he has the recordings of Neena's meeting which will expose Ravikant. Ravikant shoots Arya and just when he was about to kill him Vishal comes back and kills Ravikant.\r\n\r\nArya, even though injured, rides back to his pregnant wife Suman (Swara Bhaskar). Vishal and Veera gets back to their earlier life while Ajay is jailed. The film then moves one year forward where we are shown that Ajay has re-united with Vishal and Veera once he is released from Jail. We also hear a voiceover of Arya saying \"This system of collection has been in place for years. The money from this system goes all the way up to the seniors and ministers. The nexus is not going to come to an end with just my Uncle's death. The DCP said that only two powers would survive - the politicians and the corporates. But if a policeman doesn't take bribes from any of them then he won't fear them either.\" In the final scene we see Arya leaving Veera's home once he makes sure that Ajay is re-united with his family.","TrailerLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMo9jiUeopc","TrailerEmbedCode":"<iframe width=\"850\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qMo9jiUeopc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Action","RatingCount":14,"Rating":3.3,"CensorRating":"U/A","ReleaseDate":"5/17/2013","Runtime":137,"Budget":200000000,"Revenue":230000000,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/F37208956933516857FB062CB4181F0A.jpg"},{"Id":"d67ac2b9","ImdbId":"tt2301155","OriginalTitle":"Shootout at Wadala","Title":"Shootout At Wadala","Description":"In a police van, Afaaque Baaghran (Anil Kapoor) listens to the story narrated by a gangster Manya Surve (John Abraham) who is gravely injured with a bullet-riddled body.

Some time afterwards, a robbery takes place and European printing plates are stolen. Ranvir Singh (Saif Ali Khan) watches this news on TV and smiles. Ranvir goes to a casino owner, Vikram Thapar (Rajesh Khattar), claiming to have been behind the Euro printing plates robbery.\r\n\r\nRanvir offers Thapar â‚¬1.5 billion of counterfeit currency in exchange for â‚¬500 million real banknotes. Thapar agrees, and borrows the â‚¬500 million from ex-street fighter and billionaire gangster Armaan Malik (John Abraham), and makes the trade with Ranvir. It is then revealed that Ranvir never stole the printing plates, and was conning Thapar to get revenge for a previous matter. Now, unable to return Armaan's money, Thapar is forced to give Armaan control of five casinos that he owns in Istanbul, Turkey.\r\n\r\nThe con is revealed to be a plan that Ranvir made a week earlier with Armaan, who he was introduced to by his friend Robert \"RD\" D'Costa (Anil Kapoor) and his dimwitted assistant Cherry (Ameesha Patel). Ranvir essentially gives Armaan ownership of Thapar's five casinos in exchange for a 10% commission, a fraction of the true value of the casinos. Ranvir and Armaan become friends and business partners, while Ranvir begins a romance with Armaan's half sister and 50% shareholder Alina (Deepika Padukone).\r\n\r\nAt a party hosted by Armaan and Alina, Ranveer meets Armaan's girlfriend Omisha (Jacqueline Fernandez) and sees a picture of his deceased wife Sonia (Bipasha Basu) in her wallet. He begins to charm her in order to gain her confidence. Meanwhile, he brings a lucrative deal to Armaan that will make them both billions. However, Ranvir later reveal to RD that Armaan and Thapar were responsible for the death of Sonia, and his real plan is to bankrupt Armaan. Ranvir then establishes contact with Omisha, who tells him that she is Sonia's sister Tanya, and has been dating Armaan to get close enough to kill him. However, Omisha is revealed to not be Tanya after all, and actually be working with Armaan, who already knew that Ranvir was Sonia's husband.\r\n\r\nRanvir tells RD and Cherry that his plan is to steal the Shroud of Turin. He will steal the Shroud himself, but will tell Armaan that someone else will do it, and sell it to him for â‚¬15 billion, which is a fraction of the Shroud's true value. Ranvir then plans to steal both the Shroud and Armaan's â‚¬15 billion. However, RD, who is deathly afraid of Armaan, betrays Ranvir and tells Armaan the whole plan.\r\n\r\nAfter Ranvir drinks his glass clean, Armaan reveals that Alina mixed poison in Ranvir's glass. As Ranvir slowly dies, Armaan reveals that thanks to RD he knew Ranvir's plan the whole time and he was controlling the race the entire time. Alina reveals that she was never on his side because of her blood relationship with Armaan. Omisha drives back with the money and reveals to Ranvir that she was also on Armaan's side and she is not Sonia's sister. After Ranvir dies, RD and Cherry leave after getting 10% of the money from Armaan. Alina leaves to get the private jet ready, while Armaan and Omisha retrieve the real Shroud from Ranvir's luggage locker.\r\n\r\nArmaan, Omisha, and Alina leave in their private jet. While in the jet, Armaan points his gun at Alina, revealing that all along he was planning to kill her and take her money. Suddenly, Ranvir crashes through the wall and reveals that Alina never poisoned his drink. Alina tells Armaan that she was on Ranvir's side ever since Armaan planted the bomb in her car. Ranveer reveals that RD never betrayed him, and that he himself told RD to inform Armaan of the real plan. This was to make Armaan think he was ahead of Ranvir. Ranvir then reveals that he had seen a picture of Sonia's sister before he even met Omisha.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, Ranvir and Armaan have a fight in the plane being in midair. During the fight, Armaan tells Ranvir that he killed Sonia because she had betrayed him and fled with his money. As a result of the fight, a window of the plane was broken and subsequently an object damages the aircraft's propellor. Armaan gets hold of a gun and shoots the pilot and all the parachutes except one and he along with Omisha escape with it. Ranvir and Alina were left out so that they would die as a result of plane-crash but they escape using Armaan's car which opens chutes while in the air. The plane crashes on a mountain.\r\n\r\nArmaan and Omisha goes to meet Godfather Anza and gives him the shroud, which on inspection turns out to be fake. Just then Ranvir calls Omisha and tells how after everyone left the ruins of Antalya, Alina came back to take Ranvir to the jet. Then, they reveal how Alina switched the real money with the fake money while Ranvir and Armaan were fighting in the jet. Hearing this Anza Takes everything from Armaan in return of his money, even Omisha switches sides when she sees Armaan as being penniless.\r\n\r\nRanvir and RD meet and Ranvir gives him his share. RD then says that he does not want to risk his life again and makes Ranvir promise to never meet him again. Ranvir shakes on the promise but then warns RD that promises are made to be broken. RD and Cherry then leave in one small aircraft, while Ranvir and Alina leave in another.","TrailerLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CwQ9PClSWk","TrailerEmbedCode":"<iframe width=\"850\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9CwQ9PClSWk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Action","RatingCount":11,"Rating":2.65,"CensorRating":"U/A","ReleaseDate":"1/25/2013","Runtime":145,"Budget":600000000,"Revenue":1620000000,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/55D08EDB199D94D575E4644202E2E0D9.jpg"},{"Id":"6ed93c19","ImdbId":"tt2350496","OriginalTitle":"Dabba","Title":"Dabba","Description":"Lonely housewife Ila (Nimrat Kaur) decides to try adding some spice to her stale marriage by preparing a special lunch for her neglectful husband.

Principal photography began on 27 September 2012, filming began in October 2012 and was completed by May 2013. The story synopsis is as follows...\r\n\r\nRahul Mithaiwala (Shah Rukh Khan) is a forty-year-old bachelor living in Mumbai. His parents died in a car accident when he was eight years old, so his grandparents raised him. His grandfather (Lekh Tandon) owns a chain of confectionery shops. Before his grandfather's 100th birthday celebration, two of Rahul's friends invite him to accompany them on a vacation in Goa, which he accepts. Rahul's grandfather dies on the eve of the celebration. His grandmother tells Rahul that his grandfather wanted his ashes to be divided into two partsâ€”one of each to be immersed in the Ganges and Rameswaram. She asks Rahul to take the ashes to Rameswaram and disperse them. Reluctantly, he accepts her request but is also eager to attend the Goa trip. Rahul and his friends plan to dump the ashes at Goa but his grandmother wants to see him off, forcing Rahul to travel by train. He books a single ticket on the Chennai Express, planning to meet his friends along the way. However, Rahul forgets to take the ashes, and he almost misses the train when he returns to collect them. As he tries to leave the train, he notices a young woman running to board it. He helps her and four other people board the moving train, but the train leaves the station before he can get off.\r\n\r\nRahul tries to flirt with the woman, who starts communicating by singing parodies of Hindi film songs, and explains that the four men are trying to kidnap her. Rahul lends her his mobile phone so that she can contact her friends, but the men with her grab it and throw it from the train. Rahul is annoyed, but says nothing because the men are carrying weapons. Rahul tells the ticket inspector about them, but they push the inspector into a river below a bridge. Panicked, Rahul learns that the men are her cousins, and that her name is Meenalochni \"Meena\" Azhagusundaram (Deepika Padukone). She is fleeing from a forced marriage to Tangaballi (Nikitin Dheer). Her father, Durgeshwara Azhagusundaram (Sathyaraj) is a powerful headman of the local mafia in Tamil Nadu. Meena takes Rahul to her father and introduces him as her lover. Tangaballi challenges Rahul to a duel that Rahul unknowingly accepts, due to his lack of knowledge in Tamil. On the night of the duel, Rahul escapes with the help of a local policeman, Shamsher (Mukesh Tiwari), but he ends up on a ship with Sri Lankan terrorists and smugglers. A gun battle ensues between the police force and the terrorists. When police officers investigate an arrested Rahul, he tells his story and ends up back in Komban. Surrounded by Azhagusundaram's sickle-wielding henchmen, Rahul pretends to take Meena hostage and escapes with her in her father's car, battling Azhagasundaram's men. When the car has a breakdown, Rahul and Meena quarrel and part ways. Rahul, not knowing which way to go, returns to Meena, who takes him to the Vidhamba village. Meena tells the villagers that they are a married couple who needs protection and rest. The villagers decide to help the two.\r\n\r\nMeena then realises that she has fallen in love with Rahul. When Rahul plans to sneak away, she argues, not wanting to earn the villagers' distrust. Tangaballi catches Rahul as he tries to leave, but the villagers help them escape again. Meena persuades Rahul to disperse his grandfather's ashes and travels with him to Rameswaram, where they complete the rites. On their way back, Rahul realises that he has fallen in love with Meena, and does not tell her where they are going. He takes Meena back to her father and tries to make him understand and honour his daughter's wish. He also tells Meena that he loves her. Rahul tells Tangaballi and his goons that he is ready for the fight this time. In the fight that follows, Rahul is severely injured but emerges victorious. Meena's father and Tangaballi reform, accepting that the love of a common man like Rahul is bigger than their physical ability and political influence. Azhagusundaram allows Rahul to marry Meena. Rahul then leaves a message that love knows no regional or language barriers and that with a strong heart, there is no limit to what the common man can achieve.","TrailerLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rARol7Dk2zo","TrailerEmbedCode":"<iframe width=\"850\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rARol7Dk2zo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Drama","RatingCount":12,"Rating":2.95,"CensorRating":"U/A","ReleaseDate":"8/9/2013","Runtime":141,"Budget":1150000000,"Revenue":3960000000,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/FD3EAF973D30B36AAB4ED4C9951B8BF0.jpg"},{"Id":"eb0217fe","ImdbId":"tt3415692","OriginalTitle":"Mahabharat","Title":"Mahabharat","Description":"Mahabharat is a 2013 Indian computer animated historical drama film, directed by Amaan Khan and based on the Hindu epic of the same name.

Krishna is married to Priya (Priyanka Chopra) who works as a journalist for Aaj Tak. Rohit works in a research institute for the Indian government and Krishna, while moon lighting as the superhero Krrish, is regularly fired from various day jobs due to lack of attendance. Rohit is researching on a device that will bring life to dead tissues by the use of solar energy. Despite several attempts, he fails to complete the experiment due to the high intensity of sun rays. On a usual day, Krishna loses his job from the security wing of a company when he hears news about an aeroplane whose front tyres are stuck due to some malfunctioning which creates high risk, even if landed, it may explode and so will the passengers inside. Krishna immediately changes himself to Krrish and saves the plane from accident by holding the component to make tyres free to roam.\r\n\r\nA few days later, Rohit hears about a deadly disease spreading in Namibia due to a virus whose antidote has not yet been discovered. He consults his friend Dr. Varun Shetty (Arif Zakaria) about the situation. Meanwhile, Shetty receives a phone call from Dr. Alok Sen (Asif Basra), a scientist working for Kaal Laboratories who insists on meeting him in order to reveal information about the virus and its antidote. Both Sen and Shetty are, however, murdered by Kaya (Kangana Ranaut), a shapeshifting female mutant. She is the henchwoman of Kaal (Vivek Oberoi), a handicapped evil genius who possesses telekinetic powers. Kaal creates a team of human-animal hybrids called \"maanvars\", with distinct physical powers in order to cure himself but fails. Later it is revealed the virus in Namibia was spread by Kaal himself to incur huge profits by selling its antidote, the singular source of which is his blood.\r\n\r\nRohit discovers that the virus, which is fast spreading through Mumbai, has no effect on Krishna, the pregnant Priya or himself. He, thus, makes an antidote by using the blood from Krishna's bloodstream which he spreads with the help of explosions. An enraged Kaal sends his mutants to attack Rohit and find out how an antidote was developed without using his own blood. Krrish manages to save Rohit, but Priya is injured and hospitalised. Krrish, however, manages to defeat the mutant Striker (Gowhar Khan). Kaya, carrying out Kaal's instructions, shapeshifts into Priya while Priya is kidnapped by Kaal. In the form of Priya, Kaya leads Krishna to believe that Priya has lost her child, and continues to live with the Mehras. While finding the truth behind the antidote's formula she develops an attraction towards Krishna. Failing to get answers about Frog Man's involvement with the virus attack, Rohit travels to Singapore to seek answers from Dr. Siddhant Arya's (Naseeruddin Shah) partner, where he is kidnapped by Kaal's men. Meanwhile, Krishna discovers the true identity of Priya; furious, he reveals himself as Krrish to Kaya and orders her to take him to Kaal's laboratory. Having fallen in love with Krishna, Kaya decides to help rescue his wife.\r\n\r\nAt Kaal's laboratory, it is revealed that Kaal is Rohit's son, who was created by an experiment conducted by Dr. Arya while Rohit was held hostage by him years earlier. The child was born handicapped, and was thus given away to an orphanage from where he was adopted by a wealthy man (Mohnish Behl). Kaal uses Rohit's bone marrow to successfully cure his handicap. Meanwhile, Kaya saves Priya and unites her with Krrish; she is, however, murdered by Kaal for her disloyalty. Kaal subsequently murders Krrish, and dons a metal suit. Deeply disturbed by his son's death, Rohit decides to re-use his failed experiment to bring dead tissues to life in order to save Krishna. This time, however, he absorbs the excess energy himself. The process simultaneously kills Rohit and transfers his powers to a revived Krishna. Meanwhile, Kaal threatens to destroy the city of Mumbai if Priya does not surrender to him. Krrish re-emerges and, after several unsuccessful attempts, manages to kill him using Rohit's solar experiment.\r\n\r\nSix months later, Priya names their new-born son Rohit, who also exhibits superpowers.","TrailerLink":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCCVVgtI5xU","TrailerEmbedCode":"<iframe width=\"850\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MCCVVgtI5xU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","Country":"IN","Region":"BOLLYWOOD","Genre":"Action","RatingCount":11,"Rating":2.7,"CensorRating":"U/A","ReleaseDate":"11/1/2013","Runtime":152,"Budget":950000000,"Revenue":2910000000,"PosterPath":"https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/cinemalytics/movie/C047D7114E5A1D5C5859231B06D2128C.jpg"},{"Id":"5df7a586","ImdbId":"tt2797242","OriginalTitle":"Bombay Talkies","Title":"Bombay Talkies","Description":"Avinash (Saqib Saleem), a young man, bursting into his house.
